## NATIONAL MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT

This Agreement is entered into this 1st day of January 2025

By and Between

Those Employers described in Appendix B

hereinafter referred to as the "COMPANY"

and

## those International Unions who compose THE NATIONAL MAINTENANCE COUNCIL FOR CANADA

hereinafter referred to as the "UNION"

For the purpose of maintenance, repair, revamp, renovation and upkeep work for

VARIOUS OPERATING FACILITIES IN THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA AS AGREED BY THE COUNCIL AND SPECIFIED IN APPENDIX C

The Council is composed of the International Unions as listed in Appendix "A".

Whereas the Company is engaged in the business of plant maintenance (as defined in Article 5) with miscellaneous  industries,  and  this  work  is  of  importance  to  the  Unions  herein  listed,  and  it  being recognized there is an essential difference in the conditions required to perform this type of work, the Council on behalf of its affiliates herein listed, with the Company, wish to enter into an agreement for their mutual benefit covering work of this nature.

Whereas the Member Unions have in their membership throughout the area members competent and qualified to perform the work of the Company.

Whereas  the  Company  has  employed  and  now  employs  members  of  the  Member  Unions  on maintenance work recognized by the Unions of the AFL-CIO as being within the jurisdiction of said Unions.

Whereas, in order to ensure relative equity and uniform interpretation and application, the Unions, through  the  duly  appointed  and  constituted  National  Maintenance  Council  for  Canada,  wish  to negotiate and administer the said Collective Agreement in concert, each with the other, and all with the Company.

Whereas  the  Company  and  the  Council  desire  to  mutually  establish  hours  of  work  and  working conditions for the employees on an area basis to the end that satisfactory conditions and harmonious relations will continue to exist for the benefit of both parties to this Agreement.

Whereas the Company and the Council agree that due to the particular nature of the work covered by this Agreement, there shall be no lockouts or strikes during the life of the Agreement, and provisions must be made to achieve this end.

Whereas, it is recognized that all employees covered by this Agreement, shall have the protection of all existing Federal, Provincial and Local laws applicable to employees in general, any provisions in this Agreement  which  are  in  contravention  of  any  Federal,  Provincial  or  Municipal  regulations  or  laws affecting all or part of the limits covered by this Agreement shall be suspended in operation within the limits to which such law or regulation is in effect. Such suspension shall not affect the operation of any such provisions covered by this Agreement, to which the law or regulation is now applicable. Nor shall it affect the operation of the remainder of the provisions of the Agreement within the limits to which law or regulation is not applicable.

Whereas the National Maintenance Council for Canada acknowledges and agrees to co-operate with any Contractors' Association that is or may be formed, whose mandate is to co-ordinate and harmonize the activities, functions and interests of the Employers signatory to this Agreement.

We acknowledge the land of our projects that contractors and unions alike work on in the Province of Alberta  is  the  traditional  and  ancestral  territory  of  many  Indigenous  peoples,  presently  subject  to Treaties 4, 6, 7, 8 and 10. Namely: the Blackfoot Confederacy - Kainai, Piikani, and Siksika - the Cree, Dene, Saulteaux, Nakota Sioux, Stoney Nakoda, and the Tsuu T'ina Nation and the Métis People of Alberta. This includes the Métis Settlements and the Six Regions of the Métis Nation of Alberta within the historical Northwest Métis Homeland. We acknowledge the many First Nations, Métis and Inuit who  have  lived  in  and  cared  for  these  lands  for  generations.  We  are  grateful  for  the  traditional Knowledge Keepers and Elders who are still with us today and those who have gone before us. We make this acknowledgment as an act of reconciliation and gratitude to those whose territory we work in, reside on or are visiting.

It is, therefore, agreed by the undersigned Company and the undersigned Unions that in consideration of  the  mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the Maintenance Agreement be made as follows:

## ARTICLE 1.000 RECOGNITION

## ARTICLE 11.000 STATUTORY HOLIDAYS

- 11.100 The following days will constitute the recognized holidays within the terms of this Agreement. Any other  holiday  proclaimed  by  either  the  Provincial  or  Federal  Government  will  be  automatically recognized within this Agreement.

| 1. New Years Day   | 6. Civic Holiday                           | 11. Christmas Day                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| 2. Family Day      | 7. Labour Day                              | 12. Boxing Day                             |
| 3. Good Friday     | 8. National Day for Truth & Reconciliation | 8. National Day for Truth & Reconciliation |
| 4. Victoria Day    | 9. Thanksgiving Day                        | 9. Thanksgiving Day                        |
| 5. Canada Day      | 10. Remembrance Day                        | 10. Remembrance Day                        |

Each of the recognized holidays listed in Article 12.100 shall be observed on the calendar day on which it occurs.

When any of these three identified holidays: Family Day, Victoria Day, Labour Day fall outside of the regularly scheduled work week, they will be moved into the work week for observance.

## 11.200 Holiday Observance Clarification:

On the day of observance, the Company may either pay the workforce at double-time (2) the total package straight time hourly rate or provide the day off.

- 11.300 On maintenance, the overriding factor is harmonizing statutory holidays with in-plant workers. Should the Owner determine another day be recognized for its people, this day will be recognized by Company forces.

The intent of the harmonization principle of the Statutory Holiday between the Client in-plant forces and  those  working  under  the  GPMA/NMA  Agreements  allows  for  the  alignment  for  all  personnel working  at  a  particular  site  to  observe  the  same  designated  day  in  order  to  accommodate  the operational requirements of the facility. A Client/in-plant union merely moving the Statutory Holiday for its in-plant personnel does not trigger the harmonization provision contained within the Collective Agreement. The day of observance for the Holiday remains as identified, unless direction has been given  by  the  Client  requesting  for  our  employers  to  observe  it  at  the  same  time  as  the  in-plant personnel.

In  order for the harmonization principle to be applicable, the Contractor must notify the GPMC in advance of the pending movement of the Holiday along with the designated day for observance. The designated day to for observance must be applicable to all contractors and all trades across the entire facility.

Employers will post the date to be observed no later than seven (7) days prior to the holiday.

In the absence of meeting the above and providing proper notification, the holiday will be observed in accordance with the provisions outlined in Article 12.000.

It is the intent of this clause that no employee shall lose pay on a normal shift due to taking the required eight (8) hour break rule.

## APPENDIX C

NATIONAL MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT FOR ALBERTA HOURS OF WORK PROVISIONS,SUNCOR REFINERY, EDMONTON, ALBERTA

## 1) COMPRESSED WORK WEEK ARRANGEMENTS

The Parties agree to the following amendment to the National Maintenance Agreement at the  Suncor  Refinery  Site  in  Edmonton,  Alberta  which  "grandfathers"  the  Compressed Work Week arrangements in place at the site. This Compressed Work Week arrangement will  apply  to  Edmonton  Exchanger  and  be  an  option  to  the  existing  hours  of  work arrangements covered in Article 16.000 of the National Maintenance Agreement.

This grandfathered Compressed Work Week will follow the existing arrangements on site as described as follows:

- a) The  parties  to  this  Agreement  agree  that  the  maximum  of  nine  (9)  hours  shall constitute  a  normal  days  work  beginning  at  7:30  a.m.  and  ending  at  5:00  p.m. (excluding a one-half hour (1/2) lunch break) may be utilized if restricted to Long Term Base Crew Employees. With the understanding that this work schedule is utilized to compensate the Employees for hours lost during the twenty-six (26) yearly earned days off (EDO's), in keeping with the terms of the Maintenance Contract with Suncor, Edmonton Refinery, the maximum normal work week shall be forty-five (45) hours beginning Monday at 7:30 a.m. and ending Friday at 5:00 p.m. Of the twenty-six (26) EDO's, eighteen (18) will be scheduled by Suncor and the remaining eight (8) will be designated as flex EDO's to be taken as mutually agreed between the employee and the supervisor.

It is understood that when an employee is hired with the intentions of an employment term of more than a six (6) week period, that employee will be automatically on the aforementioned Compressed Work Week arrangements and be considered as a Long Term Base Crew Employee.

Should an employee be terminated prior to working six (6) weeks, an adjustment shall be made in accordance with the terms of Clause b).

- b) It  is  understood  that  when  employees  are  hired  with  the  intentions  of  short-term employment (defined as less than six (6) weeks from the date of hire) that they will be paid in the following manner. During this six (6) week period, employees will be paid time and one-half (1 1/2) for the ninth (9th) hour.

Should the employee be employed onsite after six (6) weeks on the job, that employee will then be considered part of the Long Term Crew and paid in accordance with the Compressed Work Week payment terms (except as outlined in item (e) below).

- c) Overtime  payments  for  work  on  the  scheduled  eighteen  (18)  days  off  will  be  at doubletime (2x). If an employee is asked to work their scheduled flex day off without

<!-- image -->

being given forty-eight (48) hours notice, then the employee will be paid overtime at doubletime (2x). Once scheduled, requests for employees to work on flex days will only be made a last resort, after all reasonable options are made to find alternate arrangements.

If a long term employee is terminated without having a flex EDO within the previous six (6) weeks, then an adjustment will be made to pay any regular hours worked in excess of two hundred and forty (240) hours over the previous six (6) weeks at the applicable overtime rate.

- d) The employee will provide a minimum of seven (7) days notice when requesting flex. EDO's. Special circumstances will be considered by the supervisor wherein a shorter notice period may be allowed. It is understood that: the onus is on the employee to request the flex EDO's; that these EDO's are over and above the minimum vacation and statutory holiday required by law, and that overtime payment will not be made for flex days not taken by the employee with the exception of those circumstances outlined in items b) and c) above
- e) During a period of Plant Shutdown, all employees hired with the intentions of shortterm employment shall be paid based on five (5) eight (8) hour days Monday to Friday or four (4) ten (10) hour days Monday to Thursday and or Tuesday to Friday. Those hired for the Plant Shutdown will continue to receive compensation under the terms of short term employment until the conclusion of the work even if they are on site longer than  six  (6)  weeks.  All  Long  Term  Base  Crew  employees  shall  remain  on  the compensation terms of the Compressed Work Week arrangements where applicable overtime payments will be made for work on a scheduled day off as per Clause c).

## 2) COKER SHIFT ROTATION

The parties  agree  to  "grandfather"  the  current  coker  shift  rotation  that  is  in  place  and operating  at  the  site  under  the  current  arrangements  and  rules.  This  would  apply  to members of Labourers Local 92 currently involved in this rotation.

Should the Owner require a change to existing arrangements or additional people, the matter will be referred to the Labourers Union and the National Maintenance Council for review and acceptance prior to implementation.

All other provisions of the Alberta National Maintenance Agreement apply.
