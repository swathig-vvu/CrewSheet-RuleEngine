## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

## Whereas

An individual must be referred to a substance abuse expert following a failure to comply with the Canadian Model for Providing a Safe Workplace: Alcohol and Drug Guidelines and Work Rule (the 'Canadian Model').  Once the  individual  is  assessed  by  a  substance  abuse  expert,  recommendations  are  prepared  and  disclosed  for  the purpose of establishing expectations in accordance with the substance abuse expert's recommendations, entering into a post assessment agreement, and supporting compliance with prescribed aftercare.

After the Union becomes aware a member has violated the Canadian Model excluding owner/client required site access  testing;  the  member  must  be  assessed  by  a  substance  abuse  expert  and  comply  with  the  resulting recommendations as a condition of being eligible for future dispatches.

If the union is aware of a non-negative test result or a refusal on a site access test, the union would internally manage the situation with their member and may impose a time limited no dispatch or provide assistance under the EFAP or health and welfare program.

There are advantages to referring substance abuse expert recommendations to qualified third party professionals for administration on behalf of the Parties.  Third party professionals are positioned to offer a higher level of:

- a) confidentiality,
- b) consistency, and
- c) expertise.

Contracting the administration of substance abuse expert recommendations to third party professionals is expected to be more effective in meeting the safety objectives contained in the Canadian Model and increase the quality of service afforded to affected individuals.
