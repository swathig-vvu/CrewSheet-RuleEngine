## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

## Whereas:

- 1) The Parties are committed to creating a safer, healthier workplace free of risks associated with alcohol and/or other drug use.  Historical trends suggest meeting this objective will correlate to a reduction in workplace incidents.
- 2) The  Parties  intend  to  reduce  redundant  substance  testing  and  related  costs  and  to  expedite  access  to participating worksites.
- 3) Alcohol and other drug work rules, such as the Canadian Model for Providing a Safe Workplace: Alcohol and Drug Guidelines and Work Rule (the 'Canadian Model' ), are more effective if they are implemented in such a way as to preserve the dignity and privacy of participant workers.
- 4) Coordinating the exchange of sensitive information through a centralized third party provides greater control over the collection, use, disclosure, safeguards and storage of personal information.
- 5) Retaining the continuity of information through a centralized third party is necessary in order to reduce redundant  testing,  expedite  access  to  worksites  and  provide  seamless  after-care  support  to  affected workers.
- 6) Comprehensive  professional  third-party  case  administration  provides  for  the  effective  delivery  of education, compliance and, if necessary, accommodation strategies.  Professional treatment, education, follow-up  and  after-care  frameworks  support  affected  workers  in  maintaining  compliance  with  the Canadian Model and, if necessary, recovering from an addiction and/or dependency to alcohol or other drugs.
- 7) In 2004, the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and, in 2008, leading experts in direct consultation, confirmed that laboratory oral fluid testing is accurate, reliable and appropriate for unannounced testing.  Due to the shorter detection windows than found in urine testing, it was found that oral fluid testing is not appropriate for follow-up testing and not appropriate for testing where prior notice of the test is given.
- 8) Several arbitration cases have accepted the validity of laboratory oral fluid testing but in none of those cases was the laboratory oral fluid testing itself the subject of challenge.

Accordingly, at the time of signing this agreement the validity of laboratory oral fluid testing has yet to be established in Canadian law.
