However,  for INDUSTRIAL WORK ONLY and on a compressed work week scheduled pursuant to Article 17.00, Employees shall be permitted a break of fifteen (15) minutes in the first half and fifteen (15) minutes in the second half of such shifts.  When ten (10) hour shifts are worked, in lieu of the work breaks and lunch breaks provided herein, the Employer shall have the option of scheduling two breaks of one half (½) hour each, paid at the applicable rate, approximately equally spaced in the ten (10) hour shift.  In the event an employee is not able to take a break, the employee shall be paid  at  applicable  overtime  rates  for  the  missed  break.    When  the  hour  before  and  the  hour following the missed break are at straight tine, time and one half (1 ½ x) shall be paid for the missed break.

## 15.07  CANADIAN MODEL - REFERENCES TO ALCOHOL AND DRUG POLICY

## (a) Concurrence

Except for the matters set out in articles 11.12(b) and 11.12(c) below, the Canadian Model [the 'Canadian  Model' ],  will  be  implemented  by  agreement  under  this  Collective Agreement for the purposes set out in section 2.0 of the Canadian Model , and the Parties will co-operate with each other in achieving those purposes.

## (b) Random Testing

Notwithstanding any provisions of the Collective Agreement or any special agreements appended thereto, section 4.6 of the Canadian Model will not be applied by agreement.  If applied to a worker dispatched by the Union, it will be applied or deemed to be applied unilaterally by the Employer.  The Union retains the right to grieve the legality of any imposition of random testing in accordance with the Grievance Procedure set out in this Collective Agreement.

- (c) Site Access Testing and Dispatch Conditions

Notwithstanding any provisions of the Collective Agreement or any special agreements appended thereto, section 4.7 of the Canadian Model will not be applied by agreement.  If applied to a worker dispatched by the Union, it will be applied or deemed to be applied unilaterally by the Employer.  The Union retains the right to grieve the legality of any imposition of site access testing in accordance with the Grievance Procedure set out in this Collective Agreement.

If the Employer acting independently or as agent of the owner or if the owner itself imposes site  access  testing,  section  5.5  of  the  Canadian  Model  will  not  be  applicable  to  testing pursuant to section 4.7.  In addition, neither the Union nor the individual will be under any obligation under the Canadian Model with respect to such a positive test.

## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

There will be no mandatory referrals for site access test failures or no shows for new hires, as no employment relationship has yet been established. However, the employer will be required to provide notice to the union within two business days from the date they become aware of the results.

The union shall be responsible for reimbursement to the employer, for the associated costs of the pre-access alcohol and drug tests, if the worker is dispatched (list hired) from the union hall and provides a non-negative result for the alcohol and/or drug test, refuses to test or is a no-show for the test. The union may seek reimbursement from the member for the costs reimbursed to the employer. This clause would not be applicable if the worker was name hired by the employer.

The member may choose to voluntarily self-disclose/refer to the Case Managed Aftercare program (SAE/RTWT/PAC/FUT).

Note: This principle does not apply to site transfers as that site access test occurs during the employment relationship.

## (d) Test Results

The  employer,  upon  request  from  an  employee  or  former  employee,  will  provide  the confidential written report issued pursuant to 4.9 of the Canadian Model in respect to that employee or former employee.

## (e) Reasonable Cause and Post Incident Testing

Any drug testing required by the employer pursuant to 4.4, 4.5 or 4.6 of the Canadian Model shall be conducted by oral fluid testing in accordance with 4.8.2 of the Canadian Model .

## (f) Collection Site Documentation

In the event that an individual's collection is determined to be incomplete or a refusal, with the consent and authorization of the individual, the Union shall, upon request, be promptly provided with the information documented pursuant to sections A-2 Urine Testing and/or A-2 Oral Fluid (11) of Appendix A of the Canadian Model .

## (g) Point of Collection Testing (POCT )

If an employer requests a worker to participate in a POCT risk assessment pursuant to 4.8.5 of the Canadian Model , and the worker provides the urine sample, and the laboratory drug test  result  is  negative,  the  worker  shall  be  paid  for  any  time  the  worker  would  have otherwise worked while waiting for the laboratory result, except for such discipline that was justified  by  the  worker's  conduct  in  respect  to  the  incident  or  reasons  for  the  test request.  If the worker declines to provide the sample for the POCT risk assessment and the laboratory drug test result is negative, the worker shall not be entitled to any pay for time the worker would have otherwise worked while waiting for the laboratory result.
