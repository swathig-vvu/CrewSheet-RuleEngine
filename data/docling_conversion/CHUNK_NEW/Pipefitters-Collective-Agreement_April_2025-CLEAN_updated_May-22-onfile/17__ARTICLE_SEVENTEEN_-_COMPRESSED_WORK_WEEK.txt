## ARTICLE SEVENTEEN - COMPRESSED WORK WEEK

- 17.01 (a) The maximum of ten (10) hours shall constitute a normal day's work beginning at 7:00 AM and ending by 6:00 PM (except when one-half (½) hour lunch is taken in which case the normal day will end at 5:30 PM).  The maximum normal work week shall be forty (40) hours beginning Monday at 7:00 AM and ending Thursday at 6:00 PM.  The above schedule is intended to represent a normal workday or work week and is not to be construed as a guarantee of hours of work per day or per week or with respect to days in a week.

- (b) The Employer may vary the start/quit times by changing the scheduled starting time up to thirty minutes at their option.
- (c) Variances  beyond  thirty  minutes  shall  be  agreed  mutually  by  the  Employer  and  the Business Representative of the Union.
- (d) A  change  in  start/quit  times  shall  be  applied  consistently  on  the  jobsite  and  in  no circumstances shall split shifts be created, unless mutually agreed between the parties.
- 17.02 (a) The Employer may schedule the regular work week in four (4) consecutive ten (10) hour days, at straight time rates, provided only that the four (4) ten (10) hour days are scheduled during the Monday through Thursday period unless varied by mutual consent between the Employer and the Union. Such consent will not be unreasonably withheld.  On a four (4) ten (10) schedule, when Friday is worked, the first ten hours shall be paid at one and oneha1f (1½x) times the applicable rate of pay.
- (b) A ten (10) on and four (4) off schedule may also be established as a compressed work week schedule and when utilized, the straight time days will be Tuesday through Friday in one week followed by Monday through Thursday in the subsequent week.  Should an employee work on the scheduled days off, the Friday and Monday will be paid at time and one half (1½x), and the Saturday and Sunday will be paid at double time (2x).
- (c) When a ten (10) on and four (4) off schedule is utilized, overtime on the Saturday and Sunday that fall in the middle of the schedule will be optional.  Employees will be required to give seventy-two (72) hours' notice of their intention not to work such overtime.  Failure to  provide  the  required  notice  and  report  for  work  shall  be  considered  absenteeism. Exercising this option will not preclude an employee's opportunity to work other premium days when available.
- 17.03 Where these options are worked, all hours in excess of ten (10) hours per day Monday through Thursday, shall be paid for at two (2x) times the applicable rate of pay.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all overtime hours on Commercial/Institutional projects shall be paid for at the rate of time  and  one-half  except  for  work  in  Local  488's  jurisdiction  where  work  on  Sundays  and Statutory Holidays shall be paid at double time.
- 17.04 When job circumstances merit a change in the hours of work, the Employer shall notify the Union office at least seven (7) calendar days, where practical, before such change becomes effective.
- 17.05 INDUSTRIAL The  Parties  hereto  understand  and  agree  that  on  job  sites  or  where  special  conditions  apply, scheduling of extended work weeks and/or days off may be beneficial to completion of the work. The Union and the Employer will mutually agree to a work schedule to meet job conditions. If a work schedule that is not currently addressed in the collective agreement is requested by the owner, the Parties' agreement to implement the work schedule as per the Owner's request which will not

be unreasonably withheld.

## 17.06 Overtime and Personal Time Off

- (a) It is accepted that a worker may, from time to time, require personal time off from work to deal with personal matters.  An employee who has not been absent, including late arrivals or  early  quits,  or  granted  leave  in  the  previous  calendar  30  days,  and  who  gives  the Employer at least three working days' notice of a request for leave of up to one day, will be granted the requested leave.  Requests for time off that meet the above conditions will not be unreasonably denied subject to operational requirements.
- (b) A worker who is preauthorized to take personal time off pursuant to the above procedure, will qualify for overtime premiums for any work performed either preceding or following the normal scheduled hours of work on the day they take their personal absence regardless of whether or not they have worked the full eight or ten hours as scheduled for that shift. In the case of a worker on a compressed work week schedule they would also be paid normal overtime premiums for any hours worked on the compressed work weekday off.  It is also understood that, provided such absences conform to these conditions, the absence will not disqualify the worker from working overtime scheduled for that week.
- (c) Overtime premiums as specified in this Collective Agreement will be paid for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in a day.  In the case of a compressed work week, overtime premiums will be paid for hours worked in excess of ten in a day or forty in a week.  A worker that is absent from work without pre-authorization as per the above procedure, including late arrivals or early quits will be subject to discipline in accordance with their employer's policies and may also be disqualified from working scheduled overtime in the week the absence occurs.  Workers who are absent from work without pre-authorization, must work the minimum normal hours as stipulated above prior to overtime premiums being paid.
- (d) All overtime hours per the work week will be payable if the scheduled straight time hours and  overtime  hours  are  worked  as  per  the  work  week  schedule,  excluding  excusable absences  hours  missed.  If  scheduled  straight  time  hours  are  missed  due  to  unexcused absences the worker must work their straight time hours scheduled before overtime hours are earned. The employee will notify the employer prior to shift start time, to be accepted as an excusable absence when circumstances arise beyond the workers' control.
