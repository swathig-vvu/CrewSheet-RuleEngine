## ARTICLE TWENTY-NINE - TRAVEL, TRAVEL ALLOWANCE, TRANSPORTATION AND ACCOMMODATION

## Daily Travel

- 29.01 The  following  conditions  as  listed  in  Clauses  29.01  to  29.03  will  apply  on  jobs  within  daily commuting distance of Edmonton, Calgary, or any location with a hiring hall, and on jobs from which Employees commute daily from temporary accommodation provided or paid for by the Employer.
- (a) A forty-five (45) kilometer radius free zone from the center of the cities of Edmonton or Calgary; (Geodetic Monument) or around any place in which Employees are temporarily domiciled by the Employer shall be established.  The location of the Geodetic Monument for Edmonton is 101 Street and Jasper Avenue and for Calgary, the Calgary Tower.  No transportation or travel allowance shall be applicable within the free zone
- (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, on major construction projects located within the free zone, around the cities of Edmonton and Calgary, but beyond the city bus transportation system of those cities, where it is expected that the total construction workforce will exceed 500, the  affected  parties  shall  meet  to  discuss  the  viability  of  implementing  a  system  of providing transportation to the site.  The parties shall take into account such considerations as climate, seasons, road capacity, other projects and industries using the same corridors, workforce curves, and site infrastructure
- (c) The  time  in  transit  on  buses  between  the  site  and  the  camp  shall  be  determined  by representatives of the Building Trades of Alberta and of the Coordinating Committee of Registered Employers' Organizations, based on an average during a reference week of five test runs each way, conducted coincident with the times when workers are in transit.  This determination should be carried out twice per year, with any adjustment resulting from a determination applicable until the next determination.  Workers shall be paid an allowance for time regularly and routinely in excess of forty five minutes each way, for travel within the applicable free zone.  The allowance shall be calculated on the regular straight time base rate of each worker.  The allowance will be paid only to workers who ride on the provided buses, and only for the days on which they ride the buses.
- 29.02 (a) For projects beyond the forty-five kilometer (45 km) free zone for which daily travel is required, the Employer will have the following options;
-  to provide transportation and pay travel allowance, or
-  reimburse the Employees, as a vehicle allowance, ( See Travel Allowance Memo at www.clra.org) per kilometer traveled, each way between the edge of the free zone and the project job site daily and pay travel allowance.

The  travel  allowance  shall  be  calculated  based  on  traveling  at  80  km  per  hour,  at  the Employee's applicable base rate, from the point where the edge of the 45 km radius free zone intersects the road which takes the shortest, most appropriate route, to the project and return to the intersecting point.

The  Coordinating  Committee  and  the  Alberta  Building  Trades  Council  shall  examine, during January of each year of the Collective Agreement, the information published by

## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

Canada Revenue Agency respecting the vehicle allowance amounts that will not be treated as taxable income, and that will be permitted as business expenses for Employers.  Such information normally establishes a maximum rate for the first 5,000 km, and a lower rate for additional kilometres.  The Coordinating Committee and the Council shall determine a rate that is midway between those two rates.  The above vehicle allowance rate shall be adjusted, effective on the first pay period following May 1 of each year, to the rate so determined by the Coordinating Committee and the Council.

Example Only -- A Journeyman member traveling to a project located 40 road kilometers from the edge of the free zone at 80km per hour each way would receive the following for each day worked:

| Travel Allowance: 80 km @80 km/hr.                          | Travel Rate             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Vehicle Allowance: 80 km.@ 65¢ per km. for a daily total of | Vehicle Rate Total Rate |

Where the Employer provides the transportation the travel allowance would be paid but the vehicle allowance would not be payable.

- (b) Where the Employer supplies the transportation, such transportation shall, at a minimum, be a safe, clean, and modern means of transportation with sufficient seating for each person allowing  adequate  comfort  for  adults.    School  buses  shall  not  be  used  for  such transportation.  Where the Employer is supplying transportation, and when the size of the crew is such that the capacity of a coach-type bus is required, such bus transportation will be provided.  Pick up points shall be mutually agreed upon.
- (c) Employees who are transported to a job site but who refuse to start work at the prescribed time  due  to  a  picket  line  or  other  form  of  labour  relations  dispute  will  not  be  paid transportation or travel allowance for that day.
- (d) When the transportation provided by the Employer for the conveyance of Employees is delayed by circumstances that are reasonably within the control of the Employer or the bussing company, the Employees shall be paid for all such time, providing the delay is in excess of 15 minutes, beyond the scheduled arrival time, up to a limit of two (2) hours at the applicable straight time rate.
- (e) If  an  Employee  is  required  by  the  Employer  to  move  from  one  job  to  another  during working hours, the Employer shall provide the transportation or pay vehicle allowance at the  rate  established  by  the  formula  in  29.02  (a)  above  per  kilometre  traveled  if  the Employee uses their own vehicle.  The Employee shall not suffer any loss of pay as a result of transferring between projects during working hours.
- (f) Employees required to travel out of a city or town to another job after working a shift, and before an eight (8) hour break occurs, shall be paid for all time traveled at the rate of time and one-half the normal rate.  If still traveling the following day, the Employee shall be paid the normal rate for time traveled during the regular working day only.

- (g) Should an Employee residing in camp accommodation be requested by the Employer or the client's designated camp management personnel to move to another room or camp, they shall be paid two (2) hours at the applicable straight time rates to carry out the move.
- (h) When an Employee is being paid subsistence allowance in accordance with Article 29.04 and when there is no suitable accommodation available within 45 km. of the project on which the Employee is engaged, the Employer shall determine the location of the nearest available  suitable  accommodation  and  shall  determine  the  number  of  road  kilometers beyond a 45 kilometer radius of the project that would be required to travel each way from the nearest available suitable accommodation, and shall calculate the travel allowance in accordance  with  those  provisions  as  identified  in  Article  29.02.    In  the  event  suitable accommodations  within  a  45  kilometer  radius  of  the  project  becomes  available,  the payment of the travel allowance will cease.

## COMMERCIAL/INSTITUTIONAL

- (d) The parties agree that wherever practical and workable in all of the circumstances of the project, camp accommodation is preferable to the provision of room and board, and that the provision of room and board is preferable to the payment of subsistence allowance. However, any of these three options will satisfy the Employer's obligations pursuant to this article.
- (e) (i) In certain situations, Employees may be dispatched or directed to work on projects which are in an area where the cost of available suitable single  room accommodation and/or meals may be in excess of the daily rate of subsistence set out in this Article.  In such a case, the Employer shall provide one of the following options:

Alternatively, an Employer may request that the Coordinating Committee of Registered Employers' Organizations issue a formal written request to the Executive Director of the Alberta Building Trades Council that a Subsistence Review Committee be established.  Upon formal written  request  the  Subsistence  Review  Committee  shall  meet  within  five  (5) working days of such request.

Appointees shall not be directly involved with the issue at hand. The  Subsistence  Review  Committee  will  undertake  such  investigation  as  is necessary  to  determine  whether  the  allowance  paid  will  allow  an  Employee  to purchase available accommodation and three (3) meals per day in the community or communities where Employees will be domiciled.  In the event that the majority of the Committee determines that the allowance is insufficient to purchase such lodging  and  meals  the  Committee  shall  determine  the  amount  by  which  the subsistence allowance shall be adjusted.  A decision of the Committee as to whether the allowance is sufficient or whether a specified adjustment is necessary shall be final  and  binding  provided  that  the  majority  of  the  Committee  agrees  with  the resolve.  Any such mutually agreed upon decision shall be issued within five (5) days  from  the  date  of  referral,  or  such  longer  period  as  may  be  agreed  by  the Coordinating Committee and the Building Trades.

The Umpire shall render a final and binding decision as to whether the subsistence allowance is sufficient  to  allow  an  Employee  to  purchase  accommodation  and  meals  in  the subject  community  or  communities,  and  if  it  is  not  the  amount  by  which  the allowance should be adjusted to afford the purchase of available lodging and meals. The  decision  of  the  Umpire  shall  be  rendered  within  five  (5)  full  days  of  the Umpire's appointment, or such longer period as may be agreed by the Coordinating Committee and the Building Trades.  The decision of the Umpire shall have the same binding effect and shall be subject to the same limited review as a decision of an arbitrator in grievance proceedings.  The fees and disbursements of the Umpire shall be borne equally by the Coordinating Committee and the referring Union.

## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

- (v) The Subsistence Review Committee and/or the Umpire shall enter into a review when determining subsistence costs and in order to come to the conclusions that are necessary to carry out the objects of this clause some guidelines are included;

Such a review within the calendar year may be made by either the Employer or the Union.
- (f) Applicable to all Regions
- (i) Employees unable to  work  due  to  legitimate  illness,  material  shortage,  job  site conditions, or inclement weather and for whom it is not practical to return to their respective primary Alberta residence (or the Union Hall in the case of non-Alberta residents) shall receive their board and room or daily allowance for those work days they were scheduled to work, during the period such circumstances continue, up to a maximum of three (3) days. If an Employee who is being provided with subsistence allowance chooses to leave a  jobsite  prior  to  the  normal  quitting  time  without  receiving  consent  from  their Employer, the Employee will receive a prorated amount of subsistence based upon the  number  of  hours  the  Employee  worked  in  the  workday,  compared  to  the regularly scheduled hours of work for the day. If the Employee leaves prior to the normal quitting time with the consent of the

Employer they will receive the normal daily subsistence allowance for that day.

scheduled within consecutive scheduled days), an employee, at the time of dispatch, will be allowed to elect to use the such employer provided transportation or to receive collective agreement initial/return/rotation allowances.  Buses must comply with Article 29.02(b).

-  An  employee who  has elected Collective Agreement initial/return/rotation allowances  will  no  longer  be  paid  any  such  payments  not  yet  received  if transportation is established and the employee elects to use it.  Such an employee will not be required to return payments received to that point.
-  An  employee who  has elected Collective Agreement initial/return/rotation allowances and who is found using employer provided transportation will become disentitled to further collective agreement initial/return/rotation allowances, as one consequence.
-  If a person who elects Collective Agreement initial/return/rotation allowances uses employer provided transportation for his initial trip that person will not receive the initial allowance payment.  This circumstance will not be a violation as discussed in the previous point.
-  Regulations shall be established for the use of employer provided transportation governing behaviour and the use of, e.g., alcohol, tobacco, and other substances.

- (c) Employees will qualify for, and receive initial transportation allowance to the job site after being employed at the site for either fifteen (15) calendar days or completion of the job, whichever is the lesser.  Should the Employee remain on the job until completion of thirty (30) calendar days, or until completion of the dispatched job requirement, whichever may be the lesser, they shall receive the return transportation allowance to be paid with their final pay cheque.

If  the  Employee  is  transferred  to  a  different  work  site  which  is  outside  the  same geographical region for which the transportation allowance was to apply (e.g., the Fort McMurray region, the Cold Lake Region, etc.), that Employee will be paid any outstanding transportation allowance(s) with their next regular pay.  If the Employee is transferred to a different work site that is within the same geographical region to which the transportation allowance was to apply, the Employee's employment on that different work site shall be deemed to be a continuation of employment on the original work site for the purposes of accumulation of entitlement to transportation allowances and rotational allowances where applicable.  Should an Employee choose not to accept a transfer, he/she shall be paid all applicable travel allowances and be considered to be laid off.
