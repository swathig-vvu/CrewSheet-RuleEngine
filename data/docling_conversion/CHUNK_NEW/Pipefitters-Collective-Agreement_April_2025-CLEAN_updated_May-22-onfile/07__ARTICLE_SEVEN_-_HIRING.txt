- 7.10 In reducing the number of Employees required, members of the appropriate Union(s) shall be the last to be laid off, depending on which jurisdictional area

the Employer's project is located in. Workers on the project may be offered the opportunity to exercise  the  option  to  accept  voluntary  lay-off  when  there  are  lay-offs  planned  on  the  project affecting their trade.  In such cases, this option will be offered to Local Union members first, travel card members second, and workers on permits third.

Workers remaining on a project following a lay-off must be capable and qualified to perform the remaining work.  For example, a lay-off of welders will not impact steamfitter-pipefitters and vice versa.    A  lay-off  of  apprentices  will  similarly  not  impact  on  journeypersons.    Within  these parameters, lay-offs will be carried out in the following sequence following any voluntary lay-offs as noted above:

## REDUCTION IN CREWS

-  FIRST: Potential members (Permits)
-  SECOND: Travel Card members (Members of Sister United Association Locals)
-  THIRD: Members of the appropriate Union

It is expressly understood that Clause 7.09 shall be in full effect in relation to any reduction in crews.

Legislated Apprentice ratios shall be adhered to at all times.

- 7.11 Members of the Union dispatched from the Union office reporting for work at the time and place specified by the Employer and who are not engaged by the Employer shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours locally or four (4) hours beyond 300 km reporting pay, plus travel allowance and expense, if applicable.

This Clause does not apply where the Employer has notified the Union(s) in a reasonable time that the Employee is not eligible for hire.
