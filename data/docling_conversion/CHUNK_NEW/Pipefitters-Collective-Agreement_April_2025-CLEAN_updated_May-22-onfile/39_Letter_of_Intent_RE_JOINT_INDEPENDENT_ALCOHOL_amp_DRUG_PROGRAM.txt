Whereas the Parties wish to establish an independent, jointly governed body to review and administer the Alcohol and Drug Program (the Program);

Now therefore it is agreed between the Parties that they shall:

1. Establish a Steering Committee responsible for creating a new independent body .
2. The Steering Committee will develop the terms of reference, shared funding model, appointment process, communications strategy, and timelines for establishing the independent body , and any other matters it deems necessary in its development.
3. The Steering Committee will establish a process for the Parties to review, provide feedback and approve the new governance structure prior to implementation.
4. The independent body will be responsible for reviewing, implementing and managing/administering the Alcohol &amp; Drug Program. The independent body will have a joint governance structure made up of equal representatives appointed by the BTU and CLRA.
5. The new joint approach to administering the Program will create efficiencies in service delivery aimed at reducing costs and improving outcomes. The Parties will share in the success of the Program and share in funding the Program (50/50 split).
6. As the Program matures, increased efficiencies and reduced costs will be passed on as savings to both Parties, as determined by the Independent Body .
7. Prior to implementation of the Independent Body and the Program each Party shall mutually agree to the Program and the funding model.

All of which is Agreed to on this\_\_\_4th\_\_day of    MAY , 2025
