Each member of the Supplier Group shall preserve said books, records and accounts during performance of the Work and until any period required by Applicable Laws or, if not required by Applicable Laws, at least two (2) years following the date on which this Contract is terminated.  The Supplier shall provide Owner and the authorized representatives of Owner with reasonable access to such books, records and accounts during such period, and in the case of any audit of Owner by any Governmental Authority, shall also provide access to such Governmental Authority's auditors upon request by Owner.
- (b) Owner and its authorized representatives shall have the right at all  reasonable  times  during  the Term and for any period required by Applicable Laws, or, if not required by Applicable Laws, for a period of two (2) years immediately following the date on which this Contract is terminated, to audit, copy and inspect all books, records and accounts and related systems of control set forth in this Article  and  shall  be  authorized  to  interview  Supplier's  and Subcontractors'  Personnel as may be reasonably necessary for an accurate audit and verification of the performance and costs of the Work.
- (c) Owner shall promptly report in writing to Supplier any error or discrepancy in respect of the cost or performance of the Work which is discovered pursuant to such audit or otherwise.  Owner may then

give Supplier written notice of its intention to make a claim in respect of such error or discrepancy. Supplier shall, within thirty (30) Days of receiving any such notice, pay Owner the amount claimed in such notice or dispute the amount of such claim in good faith and in writing.

If Supplier disputes the amount claimed in such notice in good faith within such thirty (30) Day period, such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the Dispute Resolution Procedure.
