## 32.0 SECURITY

The Supplier shall, and shall ensure its Subcontractors shall, at all times, conduct operations on Site or at any  other  locations  where Work  is  being  performed,  in  a  manner  to  avoid  risk  of  loss,  theft,  damage  by vandalism,  sabotage  or  any  other  means  to  any  Work  or  other  property,  including  real  property.    The Supplier shall comply with Owner's security requirements for Site and shall cooperate with the Owner on all security  matters.    Such  compliance  with  these  security  requirements  shall  not  relieve  Supplier  of  its responsibility  for  maintaining  proper  security  for  the  Work,  nor  shall  it  be  construed  as  limiting  in  any manner,  Supplier's  obligation  with  respect  to  Applicable  Laws  and  to  undertake  reasonable  actions  to establish  and  maintain  secure  conditions  at  the  Site  or  any  other  location  where  the  Work  is  being performed.
