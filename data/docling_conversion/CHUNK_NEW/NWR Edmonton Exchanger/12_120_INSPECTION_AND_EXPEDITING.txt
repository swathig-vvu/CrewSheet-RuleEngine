## 12.1 Inspection and Expediting

- (a) Within thirty (30) Days of execution of this Contract, Supplier shall submit to Owner for its review and  approval  the  quality  assurance  and  quality  control  procedures  Supplier  intends  to  use  in connection  with  the  Work.    Once  approved,  the  approved  quality  assurance  and  quality  control procedures shall be attached to this Contract as Exhibit G (Quality Assurance and Quality Control Procedures), and shall be complied with by Supplier and its Subcontractors in connection with the provision of the Work.
- (b) Work  provided  by  Supplier  under  any  Purchase  Order  is  subject  to  inspection,  expediting  and witnessing of Supplier testing by Owner's Personnel, who shall be granted access to all parts of Supplier's plant(s) or Supplier's Subcontractors' or vendors' plant(s) engaged in the manufacturing or processing of any Work ordered in connection with this Contract or where Work is or has been performed.    Owner's  inspection  and  witnessing  of  testing,  or  lack  of  inspection  or  witnessing  of testing, or lack of response, shall not be construed as acceptance by Owner of such Work and shall in  no  way  release  Supplier  from  any  obligations  related  to  this  Contract  or  any  Purchase  Order issued hereunder.  Supplier shall further ensure that the provisions of this Article become a part of its purchase orders to its Subcontractors and vendors for all goods, services, materials, equipment or other components which are used or incorporated in the Work purchased under this Contract. Supplier shall at all times be and remain responsible for notifying Owner, prior to the attendance by Owner's Personnel at Supplier's plant(s) or Supplier's Subcontractors' or vendors' plant(s), of any and all potential confidential or proprietary information of Supplier or Supplier's Subcontractors' or vendors that Owner may be exposed to or be given access to during any such attendance in the course of the performance of this Contract.  Any failure by Supplier to notify Owner as aforesaid shall entitle Owner during the Term and at all times thereafter to treat any and all such information as  non-confidential  or  non-proprietary,  as  the  case  may  be,  and  such  information  shall  for  all purposes be deemed not to be confidential or proprietary.
- (c) In  the  event  the  Supplier  covers  up  the  Work  to  be  inspected  or  tested  or  otherwise  makes  it unavailable  or  inaccessible  without  Owner's  prior  authorization,  and  such  Work  was  to  be inspected, tested or witnessed by Owner, the Supplier shall make such Work available at its own cost and shall remedy any delay caused by the Supplier's actions at its own cost.
- (d) Supplier  or  Supplier's  Subcontractors  and  vendors  shall  notify  Owner  at  least  five  (5)  Business Days in advance of the date the inspection or test can be made.  If for any reason the date should be  set  back,  Supplier  shall  telephone,  facsimile  or  e-mail  Owner  immediately  to  notify  Owner thereof and arrange for an alternate date.
- (e) Supplier  shall  not  ship  the  Goods  set  forth  in  any  Purchase  Order  without  either  Owner's  final inspection  or  a  written  waiver  of  inspection  from  Owner.    Any  violation  of  this  requirement  shall constitute a rejection of the Goods, with subsequent costs for return or other action as warranted against Supplier's account.
- (f) Complete and accurate information is required to maintain the overall schedule for the delivery of Goods and for the overall Refinery.  Unless otherwise stated, every fourteen (14) Days during the Term, Supplier shall,  as  a minimum,  furnish  to  Owner  confirmation of  the  then current  status  of engineering,  material  procurement,  production  and  shipping  information  in  respect  of  the  Goods being manufactured, constructed, assembled or delivered by Supplier.
