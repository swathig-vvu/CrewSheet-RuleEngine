## Attached to and forming part of C1000776

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

KPIs will be used to monitor and manage performance with a goal to continually improve performance.

Owner reserves the right to modify the KPIs with Supplier agreement as appropriate to ensure that they are fully  aligned with the Owner business drivers.  The relative weightings for the KPIs will be discussed and agreed annually for the Agreement and on a project specific basis for any turnaround or major maintenance event.
