## ARTICLE 7.00 -WELDING TESTS

## 7.01

Any welder who is required to do additional testing by the Employer, shall be paid for weld time of four (4) hours per successful test (excluding the boiler ¼ Down Hand Plate or other single ¼ plate test, will be paid two (2) hours). Additional test consists of three plates welded in the vertical, horizontal and overhead positions and will be paid a maximum of four (4) hours total, upon successful completion. Those requested to take an abbreviated version of the plate test will be compensated at one and a half (1.5) hours for each successful plate test.

Any  welder  required  to  take  additional  welding  qualifications  for  employment with  an Employer and who fails the required weld test, QW-320 of Section 9 of the ASME Code will come into  effect.  At  the  sole  discretion  of  the  Weld  Test  Examiner,  the  welder  may  be  granted  the opportunity to take a second test.  In any event a welder will not be paid for a failed test.

If  a  welder is required to test at the job site, the welder shall be paid for any applicable travel allowance, but not for the failed test.

If  an  Employer  is  requesting  more  than  three  (3)  tests  per  welder  and  a  welder  has successfully completed three (3) of four (4) tests, the Employer may retain the welder and pay for the three (3) successful weld test.  If the Employer decides not to retain the welder, he or she will be paid for the three (3) successful weld tests.

For every required test and any examiner permitted second test the Employer will pay the transfer fees, materials and inspector fees.

## 7.02

Should a secondary test be required by the Employer, the employee shall be paid for the time required to take such a test.

When a welder is required to perform a test of a type other than a standard Provincial test, the  Employer  shall,  on  request,  make  available  suitable  material  to  allow  a  brief  period  of practice prior to taking the actual test.

## 7.03

Any welder possessing a current Provincial Government welding certificate of qualification,  who  is  instructed  to  proceed  to  take  tests,  necessitating  their  having  to  travel outside of the city limits of the city in which they reside or are employed, shall be reimbursed in an amount necessary to compensate them for travel allowance, transportation, travel expenses, subsistence allowance, if applicable. The Employer and the Local Lodge will communicate and mutually agree to related costs and test location(s) before proceeding with the testing.

## 7.04

Welders passing a test will be furnished a copy of the test papers from the Employer or party  requiring  the  test  within  thirty  (30)  days,  or  upon  completion  of  the  job,  whichever  is sooner,  provided  they  are  available  at  that  time;  otherwise  the  Employer  will  provide  a  letter confirming the test and the results.

## 7.05

Where a welder is to take an official Provincial test on which the issuance or re-issuance of their certificate will depend, they shall not be required to do so under conditions which would

unfairly affect their ability to perform the test.

For  other  tests,  the  Employer  may  prescribe  test  conditions  approximating,  but  not exceeding, conditions which may be encountered on the job.

Welders required to take any test shall be allowed to complete the test.

## 7.06

Any welder who successfully completes the welding test, but fails to report for work as notified,  without  a  bona  fide  reason  acceptable  to  the  Employer,  will  not  be  eligible  for  any payment, including testing time and other allowances, as set out in Article 7.00.

## 7.07

Any welder required to take a pre-job welding test for employment with an Employer and fails the required weld test, the welder may be granted the opportunity to take a second test.

## 7.08

Alloy welders with a valid alloy welding certificate will be paid an additional premium of three dollars and twenty-five cents ($3.25) per hour worked if certification was a requirement for dispatch.

If a welder on site who was not dispatched as an alloy welder, but has the certification, or is requested  to  be  certified  by  the  Employer  and  is  requested  to  perform  alloy  welding,  the employee will be reclassified as an alloy welder and paid the alloy welder premium from the date of re-classification.

This  premium shall  not pyramid  on  an  overtime  hour;  however,  it  will  attract  applicable Vacation and Statutory Holiday Pay.
