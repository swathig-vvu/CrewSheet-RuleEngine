An employee's residence is the place where they permanently maintain a self-contained domestic establishment (a dwelling place, apartment, or similar place of residence where a  employee generally sleeps and eats) in which they reside and for which they can show proof acceptable to the Employer. An Employer choosing to lay-off a local resident and keep a member residing outside of the area will notify the affected Local Lodge.
