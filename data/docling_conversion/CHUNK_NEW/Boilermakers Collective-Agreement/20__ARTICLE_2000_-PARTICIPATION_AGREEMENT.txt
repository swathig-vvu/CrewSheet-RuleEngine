## ARTICLE 20.00 -PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT

## 20.01

All Employers employing employees  under the terms of this Collective Agreement shall be  required  to  sign  a  Participation  Agreement,  in  regard  to  Health  and  Welfare,  and  Pension Fund contributions. The Employer and the Local Lodge agree that where the Board of Trustees of the National Pension Fund or the National Health and Welfare Fund have reasonable grounds to believe that all proper contributions have not been made under this Collective Agreement, the said Board of Trustees shall have the authority to appoint an independent auditor to inspect those books and records of an Employer, pertaining to the aforesaid contributions. Where an Employer is delinquent in filing remittances pursuant to Collective Agreement and the Board of Trustees, with reasonable cause, decide to initiate collection proceedings, the Employer shall bear all of the costs of collection, including the costs of Arbitration and interest on the aforesaid monies, computed at the prime rate of the Bank of Canada.

## 20.02

The Employer's liability hereunder to all of the funds or to any beneficiary or prospective beneficiary  shall  be  strictly  limited  to  remittance  of  the  contributions  in  the  amount  and  the manner and at the times set out in this Agreement, and any consequences arriving out of such failure to remit, in accordance with the terms of the Collective  Agreement.

## 20.03

Effective on the ratification of the collective agreement (June 1, 2025) the Employer shall cease pension contributions to the Boilermakers' National Pension Plan (Canada), on behalf of those employees who are seventy-one (71) years of age or older.  The pension contributions that would otherwise be payable to the Boilermakers' National Pension Plan (Canada) are payable on

behalf of the applicable  employee to the Boilermakers'  National Health Plan (Canada).   The computation  of  the  amount  payable  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  for  pension contributions applicable to all other employees covered under the terms of this agreement.

In  the  event  the  Employer,  in  error,  makes  pension  contributions  on  behalf  of  any employee who is seventyone (71) years of age or older, the administrator of the Boilermakers' National  Pension  Plan  (Canada)  will  allocate  the  applicable  contributions  to  the  employee's account in the Boilermakers' National Health Plan (Canada).
