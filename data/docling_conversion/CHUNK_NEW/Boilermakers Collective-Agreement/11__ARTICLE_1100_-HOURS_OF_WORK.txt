Forty (40) hours shall constitute a normal week's work, Monday through Friday inclusive.

Variances  beyond  one  (1)  hour  of  7:00  a.m.  and  6:00  p.m.  shall  be  agreed  mutually between the Employer and the Local Lodge Business Manager/Secretary-Treasurer. The one (1) hour variance is conditional upon the Employer giving the Local Lodge and affected employees appropriate advance notice.

If  the  foregoing  starting  or  quitting  times  are  changed  without  mutual  agreement, applicable overtime rates shall be paid for any time worked before or after the above hours as a result of the change of times.

· The hours of work may be altered (between Monday to Friday inclusive) on any project by  mutual  agreement  in  writing  between  the Local  Lodge's Business  Manager/SecretaryTreasurer or designate and the Employer.

· When working under the  four  (4)  day  work  week  schedule,  Friday  may  be  used  as  a make-up day when weather conditions have caused lost time during the regular work week.

A make-up day will only be worked during the week  in which the time is lost. Work performed on a make-up day shall be paid at the regular straight time rate for the first ten (10) hours to a maximum of forty (40) hours per week, after which double time (2X) rates shall apply. In no case shall the time scheduled on a make-up day be less than eight (8) hours except where weather  conditions  dictate  otherwise.  All  time  worked  on  a  make-up  day  will  be  at  the employee's choice. Where a holiday occurs during the normal work week the maximum of thirty (30)  hours per  week  shall  form  the  basis  of  maximum  straight  time  rate.  Work  performed  on Saturday, Sunday, or Recognized Holidays shall be paid at the applicable overtime premium.

## 11.03

Employees will not be required to work less than the regular assigned hours because of the starting or quitting time of any other trade on the job.

## 11.04

An employee shall not be required to work during their regular lunch break except in emergency or special circumstances, in which case, they will receive a re-assigned one-half (½) hour lunch break. If this break falls outside the regular lunch break established on the job, they shall  receive  an  additional  allowance  of  one-half  (½)  hour  of  pay  at  straight  time  rates  which shall be in addition to their regular straight time hours.

## 11.05

When working eight (8) hour work shifts, two (2) rest or coffee breaks of ten (10) minutes each shall be established by the Employer. If overtime is to  follow the regular eight  (8) hour work shift, a further ten (10) minute rest or coffee break shall be established before commencing overtime. At the sole discretion of the Employer, where a scheduled ten (10) hour workday is established,  the  rest  or  coffee  breaks  may  be  either  three  (3)  breaks  of  ten  (10)  minutes  each, (described above) or two (2) breaks of fifteen (15) minutes each.

A  change  in  the  scheduling  of  a  break  will  normally  be  communicated  to  the  affected employees prior to the end of the work cycle before the change.
