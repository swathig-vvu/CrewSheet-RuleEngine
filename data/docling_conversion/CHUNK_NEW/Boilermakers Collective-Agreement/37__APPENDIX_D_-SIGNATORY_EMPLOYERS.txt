## Article 1.502

Determination of premiums for compressed work week rates will be calculated as follows:

## Article 1.503

## Compressed Work Week Shift Premiums

- i) Number of hours on shift per cycle x number of cycles per year = NUMBER OF HOURS ON SHIFT PER YEAR.
2. ii) Number of hours on shift per year x shift premium = TOTAL SHIFT PREMIUM.

## Article 1.504

## Compressed Work Week Overtime Rate

- i) Number of hours per cycle x number of cycles per year = NUMBER OF ACTUAL HOURS PER YEAR.
2. ii) Number of actual hours per year minus number of hours in a standard year = NUMBER OF OVERTIME HOURS PER YEAR.
3. iii) Number of overtime hours per year x overtime premium (2X) x Long-Term rate = TOTAL OVERTIME DOLLARS.
4. iv) Standard hours per year x Long-Term rate plus total overtime dollars (divided by the actual hours of work per year) = COMPRESSED WORK WEEK OVERTIME RATE.

## Article 1.505

- i) A year is defined as three hundred and sixty-four (364) days (fifty-two (52) x seven (7)).
2. ii) A standard year is two thousand and eighty (2,080) hours (fifty-two (52) x forty (40)).
3. iii) Total hours per cycle is defined as the sum of the hours worked on all days in cycle.
4. iv) Number  of  cycles  =  NUMBER  OF  DAYS  IN  A  CYCLE  DIVIDED  INTO  THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FOUR (364).
- v) Number  of  hours  on  shift  per  cycle  =  SUM  OF  THE  HOURS  WORKED  ON  ALL AFTERNOON OR NIGHT SHIFTS DURING A CYCLE.
6. vi) A cycle is defined as the number of days, including scheduled days off, before the schedule repeats itself.

## Article 1.506

When working ten (10) hours with two (2) fifteen (15) minute paid breaks and a half (1/2) hour lunch,  the  midday  lunch  period  of  one-half  (1/2)  hour  on  workdays  of  ten  (10)  hours  or  less between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m. will be unpaid.

## Article 1.507

## Article 1.509.1

2. ii) If  an  employee has started work during a normal work week Monday through Sunday, is then changed to a Compressed Work Week schedule and given the required earned days off, they  shall  be  paid  straight  time  for  all  scheduled  hours  worked  on  the  new  Compressed Work Week shift.

## Article 1.510.4

Earned days off on a Compressed Work Week are days which are scheduled as regular days off and are earned when regular scheduled consecutive work days immediately preceding have been worked.

If a fraction of the regular work days are worked the same fraction of the immediately following regular days off are earned. Any fraction of a day shall be considered one day when calculating earned days off.

Original Documents (not photocopies) are required for proof of residence. These will be verified by the Employer, copied and returned.

## Article 4.000 -Wood Buffalo Regional Transfers

The Employer may transfer up to  twenty (20)  employees within the Wood Buffalo region on sites with a common Owner/Client when an increase of employees is required. Transfers are not

permitted  to  displace  existing  employees.  It  is  understood  that  an  employee  has  the  right  to refuse a transfer. A request for additional transfers beyond the  twenty (20) employees may be mutually agreed upon between the Local Lodge and the Employer.

Transfers from one site to another will not trigger additional initial and terminal travel payments, however, should an employee be required to move from one (1) camp to another or from one (1) room to another, the provisions of Article 15.08 will apply.

## Article 5.000 - Bereavement

For those employees with more than three (3) years of service with an Employer, the employee will be entitled to bereavement pay benefits of eight (8) hours multiplied by the employees' base wage rate for up to three (3) days of lost work incurred as a result of the employee's attendance at a funeral or memorial service upon the death of an employee's Spouse, Child, Parent, Parent -inLaw, Grandparent or Sibling.

## APPENDIX B

## CF INDUSTRIES - SCHEDULED DAY OFF SCHEDULE

## Appendix -Scheduled Day Off Schedule (SDO), CF Industries (Medicine Hat)

To  harmonize  with  the  Owner's  in  plant  personnel  at  CF  Industries,  the  Employer  has  been approved to work an 8-9-9-8-8 work week on a Monday to Friday rotation at the facility. It is intended for on-going work (core maintenance work) and does not operate in unplanned outages, scheduled outages or during 'major shutdown' situations.

Guidelines of the 8-9-9-8-8 Schedule are as follows:

- 1) The schedule for regular core maintenance activities will operate on an 8-9-9-8-8 rotation on a Monday to Friday basis.
- 2) Employees will be paid in full for all hours worked each week. (For example, if someone completes the regular  8-9-9-8-8  schedule,  they  will  be  compensated  for  forty-two  (42) hours  at  the  regular  straight  time  hourly  rate  and  all  required  contributions  under  the collective agreement will be compensated based upon fort-two (42) hours.
- 3) The first two hours of overtime on the 8-9-9-8-8 will be compensated at time and one half (1 ½).
- 4) The Employer will identify the core maintenance personnel who will operate under the SDO schedule.
- 5) When  submitting  requests  for  craft  personnel  to  the  local  union,  the  Employer  will identify if the individual being hired is to be part of the core maintenance team.
- 6) The Employer will keep a record for each employee and track the number of nine (9) hour days  worked at straight time.
- 7) Should an employee be asked to work a Scheduled Day Off the following will apply:
- a) Work on a SDO will be on a voluntary basis.
- b) All  work  on  the  SDO  will  be  paid  in  accordance  with  the  number  of  hours  an individual employee has worked since the last SDO. For example: if an individual has worked three (3) of the scheduled nine (9) hour days and are asked to work an SDO, the first five (5) hours on the schedule will be paid at the straight time rate and all additional  hours  will  be  compensated  at  the  appropriate  overtime  rate  as  per  the collective agreement.
- c) The SDO schedule will be suspended during unscheduled and scheduled outages as well  as  during  major  shutdowns/turnarounds.  (The  e mployee's  accumulated  hours worked on the nine (9) hour days will remain frozen until their return to the regular SDO Schedule.)
