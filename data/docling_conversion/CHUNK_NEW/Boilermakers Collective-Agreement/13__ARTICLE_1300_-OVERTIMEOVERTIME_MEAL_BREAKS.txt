Any unscheduled overtime will be voluntary and worked at the employees' discretion.

- b) Two (2) or Three (3) Shift Operation: Employees working overtime shall continue to receive their shift premium for all hours worked. The shift premium shall not be compounded for overtime hours worked.

## 13.02

Overtime Meal Breaks: When an employee works beyond ten (10) hours per day, they shall  be  entitled  to  a  meal  break  and  meal  supplied  by  the  Company.  The  meal  break  will  be provided after ten (10) hours of work and subsequent meal breaks each four (4) hours thereafter. However,  it  will  be  the  prerogative  of  the  Company  in  conjunction  with  the  Job  Steward  to arrange meal breaks for efficiency and convenience of the job.

When the four (4) ten (10) hour day option is worked, recognizing emergency situations will arise, if the Company has not scheduled in excess of the ten (10) hour shift, the Company shall be granted a one (1) hour extension where a meal and meal break are not required.

When an  employee  works  Scheduled  Overtime  (work  performed  on  Saturdays,  Sundays and Holidays) they shall be entitled to a meal break when overtime work exceeds ten (10) hours).

When  an  employee  works  Short  Notice  Emergency  Call-Out  Overtime  (overtime  work performed other than continuous with the regular work day or Scheduled Overtime) they shall be entitled to a meal break when overtime work exceeds four (4) hours.

Entitlement to subsequent meal breaks will occur at approximately four (4) hour intervals during continuing overtime. No entitlement shall occur at the conclusion of overtime.

All  overtime  meal  breaks  will  be  thirty  (30)  minutes  in  duration  and  will  be  paid  for  at straight time rates. However, in calculating entitlement to a meal, the thirty (30) minute break shall not count as overtime work.

## 13.03

When a supervisor is required to:

- a) Start up to one (1) hour earlier, or
- b) Finish up to one (1) hour later, or
- c) Start  up  to  one-half  (1/2)  hour  earlier  and  finish  up  to  one-half  (1/2)  hour  later  than  the foreperson's  crews, for the purposes of organizing work, obtaining permits or facilitating a

transition to another shift, the foreperson shall not be entitled to a meal or meal break as per article 13.02, unless those provisions are applicable to the rest of the crew or the  supervisor works more than two (2) hours beyond the end of their scheduled shift.

- d) Recognizing emergency situations will arise, if the Employer has not scheduled in excess of the eleven (11) hour shift, the Employer shall be granted a one (1) hour extension where the Employer need not supply a hot meal.

This shall also apply to those employees who are required to arrive at work earlier than their crew on a continual basis to execute work of a preparatory nature for the impending shift. This article will not be applicable to 'one -off' work assignments.

## 13.04

## Overtime Meal Allowance

It is understood that while the best possible situation is to provide an overtime meal and take a thirty (30) minute break at straight-time rates, it is also recognized that there may be some situations  where  it  is  impractical  to  provide  an  overtime  meal.  When  such  events  occur,  the Employer shall provide the employees:

## A) Scheduled Overtime

(Notification  must  be  provided  prior  to  the  end  of  the  current  shift  for  the  following day(s), to be considered as scheduled overtime).

- I) a payment of thirty (30) minutes at the straight-time total package hourly rate in lieu of the meal break, and
2. II) a fifteen (15) minute rest break at the applicable rate of pay.

## B) Unscheduled Overtime

- I) a payment of forty dollars ($40.00) as a meal allowance.
2. II) a payment of thirty (30) minutes at the straight-time total package hourly rate in the lieu of meal break, and
3. III) a fifteen (15) minute rest break at the applicable rate of pay.

## 13.05

## Overtime Meal Allowance for those on Subsistence or staying in camp:

There shall be no meal allowance applicable to those receiving subsistence, however any reduction to the current subsistence rates will attract a meal allowance payment equivalent to the reduction.      Where  a  camp  is  provided,  employees  will  not  receive  the  forty  dollars  ($40.00) meal allowance where they are able to receive a camp meal at the end of their shift.
