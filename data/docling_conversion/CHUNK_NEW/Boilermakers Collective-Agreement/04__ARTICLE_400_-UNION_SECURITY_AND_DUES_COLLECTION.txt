## ARTICLE 4.00 -UNION SECURITY AND DUES COLLECTION

## 4.01

The Employer agrees to employ as employees, members of the Union in the performance of all work within the scope of this Agreement and to continue in its employ, only employees who are members in good standing with the Local Lodge. Except as otherwise provided, all such employees  shall  be  hired  through  the  Local  Lodge  offices.  The  Employer  shall  advise  the appropriate Local Lodge office, in advance of the start of a job, except in cases of emergency work where the Employer is unable to contact the Local Lodge office in which case they may commence work and notify the Local Lodge office as soon as possible. Emergency work is to mean 'any customer defined work that requires immediate dispatch.'

## 4.02

The  Local  Lodge  agrees  to  furnish  competent  available  workers  to  the  Employer  on request, provided however, that the Employer shall have the right to determine the competency and qualifications  of  its  employees  and  to  discharge  any  employee  for  any  just  and  sufficient cause. The Employer shall not discriminate against any employee by reason of their membership in  the  Local  Lodge  or  their  participation  in  its  lawful  activities.  The  Employer  will  provide written response to the Local Lodge upon refusal to hire.

The parties recognize that we are in a highly competitive industry and to maintain and enhance our market share, Boilermakers and Supervisory Personnel must continuously train and upgrade to perform the diversified tasks required of them. The parties will make every effort to provide the necessary training and education programs and will encourage full participation.

## 4.03

The parties are committed to eliminating unnecessary, duplicative safety training.

Therefore,  employees  are  expected  to  disclose  to  the  Employer  any  current  safety  training certificates  that  may  be  required  for  that  job,  as  identified  by  the  Employer  at  the  point  of dispatch. The Employer shall supply a single point of contact for the purpose of supplying this information in written format. Similarly, Employers will be responsible to forward to the  Local Lodge,  copies  of  safety  certificates  for  all  safety  training  that  is  done  on  jobsites  by  the Employer.

Following  the  acceptance  of  a  Dispatch  Slip,  employees  shall  promptly  remit  to  the Employer, copies of any applicable safety certificates at an address of the Employer or any other method that will achieve this objective.

Note: Job Ready Dispatch Safety Training Records will be maintained at the Local Lodge.

## 4.04

When the Local Lodge cannot supply qualified employees within seven (7) days of the start date requested, (excluding Saturday, Sunday and holidays), then the Employer may secure other qualified workers. All employees must receive a Dispatch Slip from the Local Lodge prior to reporting to the jobsite.

## 4.05

Upon  receipt  of  authorization  from  the  employee,  the  Employer  shall  deduct  from  all employees coming within the scope of this Agreement:

- a) From the first pay period of each month, Monthly Union Dues in the amount prescribed by the  Local  Lodge  under  whose  jurisdiction  the  Employer  is  performing  work.  The  Local Lodge shall notify the Employer and the BCA in written format thirty (30) calendar days in advance of any changes to this amount. The Employer shall be responsible for ensuring the correct amount is remitted.
- b) From each pay period, Field Union Dues in the percentage of gross hourly wages or other amount as may be designated by the Local Lodge under whose jurisdiction the Employer is performing work. The Local Lodge shall notify the Employer and the BCA in written format thirty (30) calendar days in advance of any changes to the percentage of gross hourly wages or  other  amount.  The  Employer  shall  be  responsible  for  ensuring  the  correct  amount  is remitted.

The above deductions must be mailed no later than the fifteenth (15 th )  of the following month, to the Local Lodge Business Manager/Secretary-Treasurer under whose jurisdiction the Employer is performing work.

Each remittance shall be accompanied by a list showing the employees' name, date of birth, hours worked, hours earned, Field Union Dues and Monthly Union Dues of the employees on whose behalf the deduction was made; and showing opposite each name the amount of the deduction, and, for the Field Union Dues in (b), the figure on which the deduction was based.

Any Local Lodge change in wage schedules or contributions (excluding dues) shall be provided  to  the  BCA  in  writing  from  the  applicable  Local  and/or  the  Administrator  of  IBB Benefits  thirty  (30)  days  in  advance  of  the  proposed  change.  The  thirty  (30)  day  time  frame commences once the Local Lodge has approved the amended wage and benefit schedule.

## 4.06

The  Local  Lodge  will  hold  the  Employer  harmless  from  all  liabilities  and  claims  by employees, Local Lodge or its agents other than prompt collection and transmittal of authorized deductions.

## 4.07

Should it be necessary to reduce the working forces on the job, the Employer shall layoff or terminate their employees in the following sequence:

- a) the non-members and retirees;
- b) the travel card members from other Local Lodges;
- c) the members of the Local Lodge in whose jurisdiction the work is being performed except that:
