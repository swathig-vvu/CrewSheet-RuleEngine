## Re: Continuing Case Managed Aftercare

Whereas individuals who have had a violation of the Canadian Model for Providing a Safe Workplace Alcohol and Drug Guidelines and Work Rule (the 'Canadian Model') may be required to attend post assessment counselling (PAC) and submit to follow up testing over a prescribed period of time as part of their substance abuse expert (SAE) recommendations and return to work agreement; and

Whereas PAC and follow up testing are put on hiatus when an individual not employed with an RSAP Participating Contractor or not employed thereby extending the time that an individual remains in case managed aftercare beyond the prescribed period of time in  the SAE recommendations; and

Whereas successful completion of the SAE recommendations during the prescribed period of time provides for the best opportunity of success for the individual to return to work and sustain continued employment in a safety sensitive environment;

## Now therefore, it is Agreed between the parties hereto that:

- 1) Individuals who are in case managed aftercare for a violation of the Canadian Model and who are not working for a Participating RSAP Contractor or employed under the collective agreement between the  parties  listed  above  and  are  not  eligible  for  funding  under  the Boilermaker  Contractors  of  Alberta  Employee  Assistance  Program  ('BCABEAP') eligibility  criteria,  shall  be  permitted  Local  Lodge  option  to  participate  in  continuing their  case  managed  aftercare.  The  Local  Lodge  and  the  individual  must  state  their agreement to participate in continuing case managed aftercare in writing. This written agreement will allow the required case managed aftercare to continue and be conducted during the prescribed period of time as stated in the SAE recommendations.
- 2) When the individual is not working for an RSAP Participating Contractor or employed under  the  collective  agreement  between  the  parties  listed  above;  is  not  eligible  for funding with BCABEAP; and has selected this option in writing, the individual will be responsible for all associated costs of case managed  aftercare as per the case management  eligibility  criteria  established.  The  associated  costs  may  include  the substance abuse assessment, post assessment counselling, return to work testing, followup testing and case management services provided by the third party case administrator and administrative costs.
- 3) Where  the  Local  Lodge  and  the  individual  have  agreed  in  writing  to  participate  in continuing case managed aftercare including offsite testing and where the

individual  has  either  a  follow-up  A&amp;D  test  result  that  is  reported  by  the  MRO  as  a positive, a refusal to test, or a failure to attend a collection site for a scheduled off- site follow up test, the individual's status will be classified as inactive. The individual, when classified inactive, will be ineligible for dispatch until his/her status is classified as active by  the  3 rd party  case  administrator.  The  individual  will  be  required  to  self-fund  all associated  costs  (as  listed  in  2)  above)  and  comply  with  the  recommendations  as reported in the SAE Report to be classified as  active.

- 4) This Letter of Understanding shall be attached to and form part of the maintenance agreement between the parties and its duration will mirror that of the  agreement.
