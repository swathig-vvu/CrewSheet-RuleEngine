## LETTER #3

## Letter of Understanding between

## The Boilermaker Contractors' Association (the "Association")

and

## The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Local 146 (hereinafter referred to as the "Local Lodge")

## Re: Referral for Case Managed Aftercare

## Whereas:

An individual must be referred to a substance abuse expert following a failure to comply with the Canadian  Model  for  Providing  a  Safe  Workplace:  Alcohol  and  Drug  Guidelines  and Work Rule (the "Canadian Model").

The Local Lodge acknowledges that the contractor to whom the individual would have been dispatched will refer the individual for assessment following contravention of Article 3.0 of the  Canadian  Model  for  any  site  access  testing  that  may  be  required  in  accordance  with Article  4.7  of  the  Canadian  Model  but  agrees  and  understands  that  such  referral  does  not make  the  individual  an  employee  of  the  contractor  for  the  purposes  of  the  collective agreement between the Association and the Local Lodge.

Once the individual is assessed by a substance abuse expert, recommendations are prepared and disclosed for the purpose of establishing expectations in accordance with the substance abuse expert's recommendations, entering into a post assessment agreement and supporting compliance with prescribed aftercare.

A member who has violated the Canadian Model or tested non-negative on a site access A&amp;D test must  be  assessed by a substance abuse  expert and  comply  with  the  resulting recommendations as a condition of being eligible for future dispatches.

There are advantages to referring substance abuse expert recommendations to qualified third party professionals for administration on behalf of the parties. Third party professionals are positioned to offer a higher level of:

- (a) confidentiality
- (b) consistency, and
- (c) expertise

Contracting  the  administration  of  substance  abuse  expert  recommendations  to  third  party professionals is expected to be more effective in meeting the safety objectives contained in the Canadian Model and increase the quality of service afforded to affected individuals.

Now therefore, it is Agreed between the parties hereto that:

- 1) Substance abuse expert recommendations arising from Employer administered A&amp;D tests  conducted pursuant to the Canadian Model and arising from those who violate Article 3 of the Canadian Model shall be referred to and administered by Homewood Health Inc. (third party professionals). Such substance abuse expert recommendations shall  apply  to  employment  and  prospective  employment in  respect  to  any  collective agreement  to  which  the  Local  Lodge  and  the  Association  are  signatory.  Substance abuse expert recommendations shall be shared with an Employer only if they are in respect to a current employee, who has contravened Article 3 of the Canadian Model, while in the employ of that Employer.
- 2) Service providers including Homewood Health Inc. will keep all information in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
- 3) The Association will provide the funding to the third party providers who are responsible for administering substance abuse expert recommendations.
- 4) The Local Lodge will not knowingly dispatch an individual who has violated Article 3  of  the  Canadian  Model  or  tested  non-negative  on  a  site  access  test  until  the individual has been assessed and has agreed to follow any treatment recommendations made by the third party provider.
- 5) When  an  individual  is  referred  for  assessment  by  a  substance  abuse  expert, Homewood Health Inc. shall promptly disclose the referral  to  the  Local  Lodge  in order  to  ensure  that  the  individual  does  not  obtain  a  new  dispatch  before  being assessed.
- 6) This  Letter  of  Understanding  shall  be  attached  to  and  form  part  of  and  the maintenance agreement between the parties and its duration will mirror that of the agreement.

## Re: Rapid Site Access Program

Whereas:

- A. The  parties  intend  to  reduce  redundant  substance  testing  and  related  costs  and  to expedite access to participating worksites.
- B. Alcohol and other drug work rules, such as the Canadian Model for Providing a Safe Workplace: Alcohol and Drug Guidelines and Work Rule (the ' Canadian Model '), are more effective if they are implemented in such a way as to preserve the  dignity and privacy of participant employees.
- C. Coordinating the exchange of sensitive information through a centralized third party provides greater control over the collection, use, disclosure, safeguards, and storage of personal information.
- D. Retaining the continuity of information through a centralized third party is necessary in order to reduce redundant testing, expedite access to worksites and provide seamless after-care support to affected employees.
- E. Comprehensive professional third party case administration provides for the effective delivery  of  education,  compliance  and,  if  necessary,  accommodation  strategies. Professional treatment, education, follow-up and after-care frameworks  support affected  employees  in  maintaining  compliance  with  the Canadian  Model and,  if necessary, recovering from an addiction and/or dependency to alcohol or other drugs.
- F. In 2004, the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services  Administration  and,  in  2008,  leading  experts  in  direct  consultation, confirmed  that  laboratory  oral  fluid  testing  is  accurate,  reliable,  and  appropriate  for unannounced testing. Due to the shorter detection windows than found in urine testing, it  was  found  that  oral  fluid  testing  is  not  appropriate  for  follow-up  testing  and  not appropriate for testing where prior notice of the test is given.
- G. Several Arbitration cases have accepted the validity of laboratory oral fluid testing but in none of those cases was the laboratory oral fluid testing itself  the
