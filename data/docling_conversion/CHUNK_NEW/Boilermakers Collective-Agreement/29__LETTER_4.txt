2. The Local  Lodge's agreement  in  (1)  above  is  subject  to  the  adoption  of  laboratory based oral fluid testing for the random component of drug testing administered by the Rapid  Site  Access  Program.  However,  in  the  event  laboratory  oral  fluid  testing  is successfully challenged in law, the Local Lodge agrees urine based testing shall apply.
3. Subject to (2) above, where the Local Lodge does not agree to an amendment to the Rapid  Site  Access  Program  Procedural  Rules, the  Local  Lodge  may  opt-out  of agreeing to said amendment by giving notice in writing to the Registered Employers' Organization and the Rapid Site Administrative Committee.
4. For Industrial work, the Employer  contributions shall be established by the' Association  and  may  be  changed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Association,  and notice  to  an  Employer  and  the  Local  Lodge  from  the  Association  respecting  such amendment  shall  be  sufficient.  Rapid  Site  Access  Program  contributions  shall  be forwarded  to  the  Association,  at  an  address  provided  by  the  Association.  These contributions shall be used by the Boilermaker Contractors' Association to provide the funding,  among  other  things,  for  the  third  party  providers  who  are  responsible  for delivering the services in respect to the Rapid Site Access Program.
5. This  Letter  of  Understanding  shall  be  attached  to  and  form  part  of  the  maintenance agreement between the parties and its duration will mirror that of the agreement.
