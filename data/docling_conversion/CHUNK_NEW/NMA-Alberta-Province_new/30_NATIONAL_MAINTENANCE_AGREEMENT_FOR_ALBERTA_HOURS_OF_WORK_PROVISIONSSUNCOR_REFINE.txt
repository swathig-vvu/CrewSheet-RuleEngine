NATIONAL MAINTENANCE AGREEMENT FOR ALBERTA HOURS OF WORK PROVISIONS,SUNCOR REFINERY, EDMONTON, ALBERTA

## 1) COMPRESSED WORK WEEK ARRANGEMENTS

The Parties agree to the following amendment to the National Maintenance Agreement at the  Suncor  Refinery  Site  in  Edmonton,  Alberta  which  "grandfathers"  the  Compressed Work Week arrangements in place at the site. This Compressed Work Week arrangement will  apply  to  Edmonton  Exchanger  and  be  an  option  to  the  existing  hours  of  work arrangements covered in Article 16.000 of the National Maintenance Agreement.

This grandfathered Compressed Work Week will follow the existing arrangements on site as described as follows:

- a) The  parties  to  this  Agreement  agree  that  the  maximum  of  nine  (9)  hours  shall constitute  a  normal  days  work  beginning  at  7:30  a.m.  and  ending  at  5:00  p.m. (excluding a one-half hour (1/2) lunch break) may be utilized if restricted to Long Term Base Crew Employees. With the understanding that this work schedule is utilized to compensate the Employees for hours lost during the twenty-six (26) yearly earned days off (EDO's), in keeping with the terms of the Maintenance Contract with Suncor, Edmonton Refinery, the maximum normal work week shall be forty-five (45) hours beginning Monday at 7:30 a.m. and ending Friday at 5:00 p.m. Of the twenty-six (26) EDO's, eighteen (18) will be scheduled by Suncor and the remaining eight (8) will be designated as flex EDO's to be taken as mutually agreed between the employee and the supervisor.

It is understood that when an employee is hired with the intentions of an employment term of more than a six (6) week period, that employee will be automatically on the aforementioned Compressed Work Week arrangements and be considered as a Long Term Base Crew Employee.

Should an employee be terminated prior to working six (6) weeks, an adjustment shall be made in accordance with the terms of Clause b).

- b) It  is  understood  that  when  employees  are  hired  with  the  intentions  of  short-term employment (defined as less than six (6) weeks from the date of hire) that they will be paid in the following manner. During this six (6) week period, employees will be paid time and one-half (1 1/2) for the ninth (9th) hour.

Should the employee be employed onsite after six (6) weeks on the job, that employee will then be considered part of the Long Term Crew and paid in accordance with the Compressed Work Week payment terms (except as outlined in item (e) below).

- c) Overtime  payments  for  work  on  the  scheduled  eighteen  (18)  days  off  will  be  at doubletime (2x). If an employee is asked to work their scheduled flex day off without

being given forty-eight (48) hours notice, then the employee will be paid overtime at doubletime (2x). Once scheduled, requests for employees to work on flex days will only be made a last resort, after all reasonable options are made to find alternate arrangements.

If a long term employee is terminated without having a flex EDO within the previous six (6) weeks, then an adjustment will be made to pay any regular hours worked in excess of two hundred and forty (240) hours over the previous six (6) weeks at the applicable overtime rate.

- d) The employee will provide a minimum of seven (7) days notice when requesting flex. EDO's. Special circumstances will be considered by the supervisor wherein a shorter notice period may be allowed. It is understood that: the onus is on the employee to request the flex EDO's; that these EDO's are over and above the minimum vacation and statutory holiday required by law, and that overtime payment will not be made for flex days not taken by the employee with the exception of those circumstances outlined in items b) and c) above
- e) During a period of Plant Shutdown, all employees hired with the intentions of shortterm employment shall be paid based on five (5) eight (8) hour days Monday to Friday or four (4) ten (10) hour days Monday to Thursday and or Tuesday to Friday. Those hired for the Plant Shutdown will continue to receive compensation under the terms of short term employment until the conclusion of the work even if they are on site longer than  six  (6)  weeks.  All  Long  Term  Base  Crew  employees  shall  remain  on  the compensation terms of the Compressed Work Week arrangements where applicable overtime payments will be made for work on a scheduled day off as per Clause c).

## 2) COKER SHIFT ROTATION

The parties  agree  to  "grandfather"  the  current  coker  shift  rotation  that  is  in  place  and operating  at  the  site  under  the  current  arrangements  and  rules.  This  would  apply  to members of Labourers Local 92 currently involved in this rotation.

Should the Owner require a change to existing arrangements or additional people, the matter will be referred to the Labourers Union and the National Maintenance Council for review and acceptance prior to implementation.

All other provisions of the Alberta National Maintenance Agreement apply.
