Each of the recognized holidays listed in Article 12.100 shall be observed on the calendar day on which it occurs.

When any of these three identified holidays: Family Day, Victoria Day, Labour Day fall outside of the regularly scheduled work week, they will be moved into the work week for observance.

## 11.200 Holiday Observance Clarification:

On the day of observance, the Company may either pay the workforce at double-time (2) the total package straight time hourly rate or provide the day off.

- 11.300 On maintenance, the overriding factor is harmonizing statutory holidays with in-plant workers. Should the Owner determine another day be recognized for its people, this day will be recognized by Company forces.

The intent of the harmonization principle of the Statutory Holiday between the Client in-plant forces and  those  working  under  the  GPMA/NMA  Agreements  allows  for  the  alignment  for  all  personnel working  at  a  particular  site  to  observe  the  same  designated  day  in  order  to  accommodate  the operational requirements of the facility. A Client/in-plant union merely moving the Statutory Holiday for its in-plant personnel does not trigger the harmonization provision contained within the Collective Agreement. The day of observance for the Holiday remains as identified, unless direction has been given  by  the  Client  requesting  for  our  employers  to  observe  it  at  the  same  time  as  the  in-plant personnel.

In  order for the harmonization principle to be applicable, the Contractor must notify the GPMC in advance of the pending movement of the Holiday along with the designated day for observance. The designated day to for observance must be applicable to all contractors and all trades across the entire facility.

Employers will post the date to be observed no later than seven (7) days prior to the holiday.

In the absence of meeting the above and providing proper notification, the holiday will be observed in accordance with the provisions outlined in Article 12.000.
