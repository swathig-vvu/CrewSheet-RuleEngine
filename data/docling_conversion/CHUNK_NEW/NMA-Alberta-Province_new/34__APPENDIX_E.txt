## APPENDIX E

## RE: SUBSISTENCE ALLOWANCE ASSISTANCE

The  Parties  hereto  agreed  that  attempts  would  be  made  to  deal  with  employees  requiring assistance in paying for their lodging on subsistence jobs.

It was agreed by the Parties that:

- (a) The employer, where requested by both the employee and the Business Manager of the applicable Local Union, would either:
- (i) guarantee or pay for the room with the lodging in place at an amount not to exceed the daily subsistence rate, until the employee receives their first pay cheque or completes the assignment, whichever occurs first.

or:

- (ii) provide the employee with "an advance", based on the subsistence allowance for the time period stated in (i), which will be deducted from the first pay cheque.
- (b) All requests for subsistence advances shall be confirmed in writing by the Local Union Business Manager or their designee at the time of referral.  It is acknowledged that the Business Manager will only make this request where they are aware of a legitimate need for such advances.
- (c) This arrangement does not apply where a camp is available.

It is understood that a request herein shall not be subject to either grievance or arbitration.  The Employer is expected to act in a fashion that meets the intent of this Policy to the best of their ability under the circumstances.
