As an option, ten (10) hours per day, Monday to Thursday or Tuesday to Friday may be worked at straight time. The ten (10) hour system must operate for a minimum period of four (4) consecutive days before it is established as the regular hours of work. Once established it becomes the regular hours of work for those so assigned.

When establishing a four (4) day ten (10) hour work week, the Employer will advise the affected Local Union office that a four (4) day ten (10) hour option is in place and declare if it is a Monday to Thursday, or Tuesday to Friday work pattern.

Where a multi trade project is scheduled under the four (4) ten (10) hour shift system and an Employer secures short term work that may not provide for forty (40) hours of work, all hours worked shall be paid for in keeping with the provisions applicable to the four (4) ten (10) hour shift.

In the event an employee is not able to observe their break they shall be compensated in the following manner:

- a) On a straight time, day, the employee will be compensated an additional thirty (30) minutes paid at the time and one-half rate.
- b) On an overtime day, the employee will be compensated an additional thirty (30) minutes at the applicable overtime rate.

Under schedules utilizing a half (½) hour (paid break) system, they may be staggered one (1) hour either way to accommodate production schedules and emergencies. The above penalty clauses outlined in 15.100(i) a) and b) will apply in instances when the staggered one half (½) hour (paid break) is moved greater than one (1) hour either way to accommodate production schedules and emergencies.

- 15.200 Employees working a day shift defined as a shift starting at 8:00 a.m. shall work eight (8) hours for eight (8) hours pay.

Employees working any shift that is outside of daywork conditions, shall receive a shift premium of four dollars and fifty cents ($4.50) per hour worked.

The mid-shift lunch break will be of one half (1/2) hour in duration and will be unpaid.

Where employees are requested to take a shift change, as much notice as possible will be given. If eight (8) hours notice is not provided then all regular hours worked on the first shift on the new schedule will be paid at time and one-half the straight time total package rate (1-1/2).
