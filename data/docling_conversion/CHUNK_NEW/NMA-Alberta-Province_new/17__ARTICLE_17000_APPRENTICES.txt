## ARTICLE 17.000 APPRENTICES

- 17.100 The Council and Member Unions agree that the needs of plant maintenance may warrant differing apprentice ratios than those established. The Company and the Council Affiliates, therefore, agree to negotiate such ratios from time to time as the conditions warrant.
- 17.200 The Parties to this Agreement recognize the importance of apprenticeship to the maintenance industry. The  Parties  agree  to  support,  the  employment  of  apprentices  on  maintenance  projects  to  reflect acceptable reference agreement ratios. The Company will set a target to employ a minimum of 25% apprentices  (distributed  evenly  between  the  applicable  levels  of  each  trade)  of  the  number  of Journeypersons  on  the  project  (with  30%  identified  apprenticeship),  unless  varied  by  mutual agreement between the Company and Union as job conditions warrant.

The Parties further agree that they will work together to maximize opportunities for local residents to participate in apprenticeship and to maximize opportunities for other underrepresented groups.
