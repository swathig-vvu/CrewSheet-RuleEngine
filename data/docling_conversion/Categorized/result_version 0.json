It does not contain any rules related to compensation, pay, or monetary allowances, nor does it meet the criteria for Parties, Scope, Term, or Definitions. The critical instruction for LABOUR is not triggered as there is no mention of worked time categorization, meal allowances, or subsistence."

It specifies conditions for payment (e.g., 29.04), continuance during non-work periods (e.g., 29.04(f)(i)), and forfeiture, which directly aligns with the definition of Subsistence/Living Allowances, a high-priority LABOUR category."
