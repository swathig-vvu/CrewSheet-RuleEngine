An employee's residence is the place where they permanently maintain a self-contained domestic establishment (a dwelling place, apartment, or similar place of residence where a  employee generally sleeps and eats) in which they reside and for which they can show proof acceptable to the Employer. An Employer choosing to lay-off a local resident and keep a member residing outside of the area will notify the affected Local Lodge.

## 3.08

It  is  recognized  that  there  may  be  situations  where  the  transfer  ratio  may  be impractical  or  is  found  to  work  a  hardship  for  the  Employer in  securing  work  in certain plant(s) that in such a case the ratio may be modified if agreed to in written format by both the Employer and the Local Lodge.
- d) On  crews  of  six  (6)  members  or  less  (including  the  Foreperson)  the  Foreperson  shall  be allowed  to  work  with  the  tools.  The  Local  Lodge  recognizes  that  there  may  be  situations

where a General Foreperson, Foreperson, or Assistant Foreperson is required to work with the tools to provide instructions on work procedures or where safety is a compelling factor.

Except as otherwise provided, all such employees  shall  be  hired  through  the  Local  Lodge  offices.  The  Employer  shall  advise  the appropriate Local Lodge office, in advance of the start of a job, except in cases of emergency work where the Employer is unable to contact the Local Lodge office in which case they may commence work and notify the Local Lodge office as soon as possible. Emergency work is to mean 'any customer defined work that requires immediate dispatch.'

## 4.02

The Employer shall supply a single point of contact for the purpose of supplying this information in written format. Similarly, Employers will be responsible to forward to the  Local Lodge,  copies  of  safety  certificates  for  all  safety  training  that  is  done  on  jobsites  by  the Employer.

Following  the  acceptance  of  a  Dispatch  Slip,  employees  shall  promptly  remit  to  the Employer, copies of any applicable safety certificates at an address of the Employer or any other method that will achieve this objective.

Note: Job Ready Dispatch Safety Training Records will be maintained at the Local Lodge.

The Employer shall be responsible for ensuring the correct amount is remitted.
- b) From each pay period, Field Union Dues in the percentage of gross hourly wages or other amount as may be designated by the Local Lodge under whose jurisdiction the Employer is performing work.

Any Local Lodge change in wage schedules or contributions (excluding dues) shall be provided  to  the  BCA  in  writing  from  the  applicable  Local  and/or  the  Administrator  of  IBB Benefits  thirty  (30)  days  in  advance  of  the  proposed  change.  The  thirty  (30)  day  time  frame commences once the Local Lodge has approved the amended wage and benefit schedule.

## 4.06

The  Employer  shall  pay  an  allowance  for completing the course equal to that time estimate, to a maximum of four hours, multiplied by the employee's total package and hourly rate.

## 6.07

The parties further agree that the Employer shall be responsible to re-certify all expired safety certificates or safety certificates needing renewal due to course content changes in a timely manner, for any employee who has been in their employ for more than ninety (90) calendar days.

## 6.08

The  parties  agree  to  adopt  Version  6.1  of  the  Canadian  Model  for  Providing  a  Safe Workplace  Alcohol  &amp;  Drug  Guidelines  and  Work  Rule.  The  Canadian  Model  is  a  unilateral Work Rule  created  by  the  Construction  Owners  Association  of  Alberta.  The  parties  agree  to three  (3)  letters  (Referral  for  Case  Managed  Aftercare,  Rapid  Site  Access  Program  and Continuing Case Managed Aftercare) provided to the Boilermaker Contractors' Association and the  Letter  of  Understanding  relating  to  the  interpretation  of  the  Canadian  Model  Version  6.1 (attached). Adoption of Version 6.1 of the Canadian Model does not represent agreement by the parties to any portions of the Canadian Model that may violate any rights an employee may have under the Alberta Human Rights Act and/or the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

If the Employer fails to refer the employee to Homewood Health within two (2) weeks and the employee is no longer eligible for the payment program under the BCA's funding model, then the Employer must pay all costs associated with the program on behalf of that employee.

It is understood that an investigation and a standard process for such investigation will be followed to ensure reasonable grounds have been established.

## 6.09

The  Employer  will  not  discriminate  against  any  employees  employed  under  this Agreement on the basis of any grounds protected by the Alberta Human Rights Act.

At  the  request  of  the  Local  Lodge,  on  a  case  by  case  basis  the  Employer  may  consider employing a member with physical impairment for work that suits their physical abilities.

The decision to accommodate is solely at the discretion of the Employer.

## ARTICLE 7.00 -WELDING TESTS

## 7.01

Any welder who is required to do additional testing by the Employer, shall be paid for weld time of four (4) hours per successful test (excluding the boiler ¼ Down Hand Plate or other single ¼ plate test, will be paid two (2) hours). Additional test consists of three plates welded in the vertical, horizontal and overhead positions and will be paid a maximum of four (4) hours total, upon successful completion. Those requested to take an abbreviated version of the plate test will be compensated at one and a half (1.5) hours for each successful plate test.

Any  welder  required  to  take  additional  welding  qualifications  for  employment with  an Employer and who fails the required weld test, QW-320 of Section 9 of the ASME Code will come into  effect.  At  the  sole  discretion  of  the  Weld  Test  Examiner,  the  welder  may  be  granted  the opportunity to take a second test.  In any event a welder will not be paid for a failed test.

If  a  welder is required to test at the job site, the welder shall be paid for any applicable travel allowance, but not for the failed test.

If  an  Employer  is  requesting  more  than  three  (3)  tests  per  welder  and  a  welder  has successfully completed three (3) of four (4) tests, the Employer may retain the welder and pay for the three (3) successful weld test.  If the Employer decides not to retain the welder, he or she will be paid for the three (3) successful weld tests.

For every required test and any examiner permitted second test the Employer will pay the transfer fees, materials and inspector fees.

## 7.02

Should a secondary test be required by the Employer, the employee shall be paid for the time required to take such a test.

When a welder is required to perform a test of a type other than a standard Provincial test, the  Employer  shall,  on  request,  make  available  suitable  material  to  allow  a  brief  period  of practice prior to taking the actual test.

## 7.03

Any welder possessing a current Provincial Government welding certificate of qualification,  who  is  instructed  to  proceed  to  take  tests,  necessitating  their  having  to  travel outside of the city limits of the city in which they reside or are employed, shall be reimbursed in an amount necessary to compensate them for travel allowance, transportation, travel expenses, subsistence allowance, if applicable. The Employer and the Local Lodge will communicate and mutually agree to related costs and test location(s) before proceeding with the testing.

## 7.04

Welders passing a test will be furnished a copy of the test papers from the Employer or party  requiring  the  test  within  thirty  (30)  days,  or  upon  completion  of  the  job,  whichever  is sooner,  provided  they  are  available  at  that  time;  otherwise  the  Employer  will  provide  a  letter confirming the test and the results.

## 7.05

Where a welder is to take an official Provincial test on which the issuance or re-issuance of their certificate will depend, they shall not be required to do so under conditions which would

unfairly affect their ability to perform the test.

For  other  tests,  the  Employer  may  prescribe  test  conditions  approximating,  but  not exceeding, conditions which may be encountered on the job.

Welders required to take any test shall be allowed to complete the test.

## 7.06

Any welder who successfully completes the welding test, but fails to report for work as notified,  without  a  bona  fide  reason  acceptable  to  the  Employer,  will  not  be  eligible  for  any payment, including testing time and other allowances, as set out in Article 7.00.

## 7.07

Any welder required to take a pre-job welding test for employment with an Employer and fails the required weld test, the welder may be granted the opportunity to take a second test.

## 7.08

Alloy welders with a valid alloy welding certificate will be paid an additional premium of three dollars and twenty-five cents ($3.25) per hour worked if certification was a requirement for dispatch.

If a welder on site who was not dispatched as an alloy welder, but has the certification, or is requested  to  be  certified  by  the  Employer  and  is  requested  to  perform  alloy  welding,  the employee will be reclassified as an alloy welder and paid the alloy welder premium from the date of re-classification.

This  premium shall  not pyramid  on  an  overtime  hour;  however,  it  will  attract  applicable Vacation and Statutory Holiday Pay.

## ARTICLE 8.00 -ACCESS TO JOBS

## 8.01

The  Employer  shall  grant  to  accredited  Representatives  of  the  International  Brotherhood and Business Manager/Secretary-Treasurer and Assistant Business Manager of the Local Lodge, access to all jobs insofar as the Employer has the authority to allow such access, provided the Local Lodge Representative secures permission from the Employer's senior Representative and does not cause employees to neglect their work.

## 13.02

Overtime Meal Breaks: When an employee works beyond ten (10) hours per day, they shall  be  entitled  to  a  meal  break  and  meal  supplied  by  the  Company.  The  meal  break  will  be provided after ten (10) hours of work and subsequent meal breaks each four (4) hours thereafter. However,  it  will  be  the  prerogative  of  the  Company  in  conjunction  with  the  Job  Steward  to arrange meal breaks for efficiency and convenience of the job.

When the four (4) ten (10) hour day option is worked, recognizing emergency situations will arise, if the Company has not scheduled in excess of the ten (10) hour shift, the Company shall be granted a one (1) hour extension where a meal and meal break are not required.

When an  employee  works  Scheduled  Overtime  (work  performed  on  Saturdays,  Sundays and Holidays) they shall be entitled to a meal break when overtime work exceeds ten (10) hours).

When  an  employee  works  Short  Notice  Emergency  Call-Out  Overtime  (overtime  work performed other than continuous with the regular work day or Scheduled Overtime) they shall be entitled to a meal break when overtime work exceeds four (4) hours.

Entitlement to subsequent meal breaks will occur at approximately four (4) hour intervals during continuing overtime. No entitlement shall occur at the conclusion of overtime.

All  overtime  meal  breaks  will  be  thirty  (30)  minutes  in  duration  and  will  be  paid  for  at straight time rates. However, in calculating entitlement to a meal, the thirty (30) minute break shall not count as overtime work.

## 13.03

When a supervisor is required to:

- a) Start up to one (1) hour earlier, or
- b) Finish up to one (1) hour later, or
- c) Start  up  to  one-half  (1/2)  hour  earlier  and  finish  up  to  one-half  (1/2)  hour  later  than  the foreperson's  crews, for the purposes of organizing work, obtaining permits or facilitating a

transition to another shift, the foreperson shall not be entitled to a meal or meal break as per article 13.02, unless those provisions are applicable to the rest of the crew or the  supervisor works more than two (2) hours beyond the end of their scheduled shift.

- d) Recognizing emergency situations will arise, if the Employer has not scheduled in excess of the eleven (11) hour shift, the Employer shall be granted a one (1) hour extension where the Employer need not supply a hot meal.

This shall also apply to those employees who are required to arrive at work earlier than their crew on a continual basis to execute work of a preparatory nature for the impending shift. This article will not be applicable to 'one -off' work assignments.

## 13.04

## Overtime Meal Allowance

It is understood that while the best possible situation is to provide an overtime meal and take a thirty (30) minute break at straight-time rates, it is also recognized that there may be some situations  where  it  is  impractical  to  provide  an  overtime  meal.  When  such  events  occur,  the Employer shall provide the employees:

## A) Scheduled Overtime

(Notification  must  be  provided  prior  to  the  end  of  the  current  shift  for  the  following day(s), to be considered as scheduled overtime).

- I) a payment of thirty (30) minutes at the straight-time total package hourly rate in lieu of the meal break, and
2. II) a fifteen (15) minute rest break at the applicable rate of pay.

## B) Unscheduled Overtime

- I) a payment of forty dollars ($40.00) as a meal allowance.
2. II) a payment of thirty (30) minutes at the straight-time total package hourly rate in the lieu of meal break, and
3. III) a fifteen (15) minute rest break at the applicable rate of pay.

## 13.05

## Overtime Meal Allowance for those on Subsistence or staying in camp:

There shall be no meal allowance applicable to those receiving subsistence, however any reduction to the current subsistence rates will attract a meal allowance payment equivalent to the reduction.      Where  a  camp  is  provided,  employees  will  not  receive  the  forty  dollars  ($40.00) meal allowance where they are able to receive a camp meal at the end of their shift.

and

## The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Local 146 (hereinafter referred to as the "Local Lodge")

## Re: Referral for Case Managed Aftercare

## Whereas:

An individual must be referred to a substance abuse expert following a failure to comply with the Canadian  Model  for  Providing  a  Safe  Workplace:  Alcohol  and  Drug  Guidelines  and Work Rule (the "Canadian Model").

The Local Lodge acknowledges that the contractor to whom the individual would have been dispatched will refer the individual for assessment following contravention of Article 3.0 of the  Canadian  Model  for  any  site  access  testing  that  may  be  required  in  accordance  with Article  4.7  of  the  Canadian  Model  but  agrees  and  understands  that  such  referral  does  not make  the  individual  an  employee  of  the  contractor  for  the  purposes  of  the  collective agreement between the Association and the Local Lodge.

Once the individual is assessed by a substance abuse expert, recommendations are prepared and disclosed for the purpose of establishing expectations in accordance with the substance abuse expert's recommendations, entering into a post assessment agreement and supporting compliance with prescribed aftercare.

A member who has violated the Canadian Model or tested non-negative on a site access A&amp;D test must  be  assessed by a substance abuse  expert and  comply  with  the  resulting recommendations as a condition of being eligible for future dispatches.

There are advantages to referring substance abuse expert recommendations to qualified third party professionals for administration on behalf of the parties. Third party professionals are positioned to offer a higher level of:

- (a) confidentiality
- (b) consistency, and
- (c) expertise

Contracting  the  administration  of  substance  abuse  expert  recommendations  to  third  party professionals is expected to be more effective in meeting the safety objectives contained in the Canadian Model and increase the quality of service afforded to affected individuals.

Now therefore, it is Agreed between the parties hereto that:

- 1) Substance abuse expert recommendations arising from Employer administered A&amp;D tests  conducted pursuant to the Canadian Model and arising from those who violate Article 3 of the Canadian Model shall be referred to and administered by Homewood Health Inc. (third party professionals). Such substance abuse expert recommendations shall  apply  to  employment  and  prospective  employment in  respect  to  any  collective agreement  to  which  the  Local  Lodge  and  the  Association  are  signatory.  Substance abuse expert recommendations shall be shared with an Employer only if they are in respect to a current employee, who has contravened Article 3 of the Canadian Model, while in the employ of that Employer.
- 2) Service providers including Homewood Health Inc. will keep all information in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
- 3) The Association will provide the funding to the third party providers who are responsible for administering substance abuse expert recommendations.
- 4) The Local Lodge will not knowingly dispatch an individual who has violated Article 3  of  the  Canadian  Model  or  tested  non-negative  on  a  site  access  test  until  the individual has been assessed and has agreed to follow any treatment recommendations made by the third party provider.
- 5) When  an  individual  is  referred  for  assessment  by  a  substance  abuse  expert, Homewood Health Inc. shall promptly disclose the referral  to  the  Local  Lodge  in order  to  ensure  that  the  individual  does  not  obtain  a  new  dispatch  before  being assessed.
- 6) This  Letter  of  Understanding  shall  be  attached  to  and  form  part  of  and  the maintenance agreement between the parties and its duration will mirror that of the agreement.

## Re: Rapid Site Access Program

Whereas:

- A. The  parties  intend  to  reduce  redundant  substance  testing  and  related  costs  and  to expedite access to participating worksites.
- B. Alcohol and other drug work rules, such as the Canadian Model for Providing a Safe Workplace: Alcohol and Drug Guidelines and Work Rule (the ' Canadian Model '), are more effective if they are implemented in such a way as to preserve the  dignity and privacy of participant employees.
- C. Coordinating the exchange of sensitive information through a centralized third party provides greater control over the collection, use, disclosure, safeguards, and storage of personal information.
- D. Retaining the continuity of information through a centralized third party is necessary in order to reduce redundant testing, expedite access to worksites and provide seamless after-care support to affected employees.
- E. Comprehensive professional third party case administration provides for the effective delivery  of  education,  compliance  and,  if  necessary,  accommodation  strategies. Professional treatment, education, follow-up and after-care frameworks  support affected  employees  in  maintaining  compliance  with  the Canadian  Model and,  if necessary, recovering from an addiction and/or dependency to alcohol or other drugs.
- F. In 2004, the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services  Administration  and,  in  2008,  leading  experts  in  direct  consultation, confirmed  that  laboratory  oral  fluid  testing  is  accurate,  reliable,  and  appropriate  for unannounced testing. Due to the shorter detection windows than found in urine testing, it  was  found  that  oral  fluid  testing  is  not  appropriate  for  follow-up  testing  and  not appropriate for testing where prior notice of the test is given.
- G. Several Arbitration cases have accepted the validity of laboratory oral fluid testing but in none of those cases was the laboratory oral fluid testing itself  the

## LETTER #4

## Letter of Understanding by and between

## Boilermaker Contractors' Association of Alberta

(the 'Association')

and

## International Brotherhood of Boilermakers Local Lodge 146

(the ' Local Lodge ')

subject of challenge. Accordingly, at the time of signing this Agreement, the validity of laboratory oral fluid testing has yet to be established in Canadian law.

## Now therefore, it is Agreed between the parties hereto that:

1. Subject to (2) and (3) below, the parties support the implementation of the Rapid Site Access  Program  and  the  Local  Lodge  and  the  Employer  agree  to  be  bound  by  and comply with the Rapid Site Access Program Procedural Rules, as amended from time to time.
2. The Local  Lodge's agreement  in  (1)  above  is  subject  to  the  adoption  of  laboratory based oral fluid testing for the random component of drug testing administered by the Rapid  Site  Access  Program.  However,  in  the  event  laboratory  oral  fluid  testing  is successfully challenged in law, the Local Lodge agrees urine based testing shall apply.
3. Subject to (2) above, where the Local Lodge does not agree to an amendment to the Rapid  Site  Access  Program  Procedural  Rules, the  Local  Lodge  may  opt-out  of agreeing to said amendment by giving notice in writing to the Registered Employers' Organization and the Rapid Site Administrative Committee.
4. For Industrial work, the Employer  contributions shall be established by the' Association  and  may  be  changed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the  Association,  and notice  to  an  Employer  and  the  Local  Lodge  from  the  Association  respecting  such amendment  shall  be  sufficient.  Rapid  Site  Access  Program  contributions  shall  be forwarded  to  the  Association,  at  an  address  provided  by  the  Association.  These contributions shall be used by the Boilermaker Contractors' Association to provide the funding,  among  other  things,  for  the  third  party  providers  who  are  responsible  for delivering the services in respect to the Rapid Site Access Program.
5. This  Letter  of  Understanding  shall  be  attached  to  and  form  part  of  the  maintenance agreement between the parties and its duration will mirror that of the agreement.

## Re: Continuing Case Managed Aftercare

Whereas individuals who have had a violation of the Canadian Model for Providing a Safe Workplace Alcohol and Drug Guidelines and Work Rule (the 'Canadian Model') may be required to attend post assessment counselling (PAC) and submit to follow up testing over a prescribed period of time as part of their substance abuse expert (SAE) recommendations and return to work agreement; and

Whereas PAC and follow up testing are put on hiatus when an individual not employed with an RSAP Participating Contractor or not employed thereby extending the time that an individual remains in case managed aftercare beyond the prescribed period of time in  the SAE recommendations; and

Whereas successful completion of the SAE recommendations during the prescribed period of time provides for the best opportunity of success for the individual to return to work and sustain continued employment in a safety sensitive environment;

## Now therefore, it is Agreed between the parties hereto that:

- 1) Individuals who are in case managed aftercare for a violation of the Canadian Model and who are not working for a Participating RSAP Contractor or employed under the collective agreement between the  parties  listed  above  and  are  not  eligible  for  funding  under  the Boilermaker  Contractors  of  Alberta  Employee  Assistance  Program  ('BCABEAP') eligibility  criteria,  shall  be  permitted  Local  Lodge  option  to  participate  in  continuing their  case  managed  aftercare.  The  Local  Lodge  and  the  individual  must  state  their agreement to participate in continuing case managed aftercare in writing. This written agreement will allow the required case managed aftercare to continue and be conducted during the prescribed period of time as stated in the SAE recommendations.
- 2) When the individual is not working for an RSAP Participating Contractor or employed under  the  collective  agreement  between  the  parties  listed  above;  is  not  eligible  for funding with BCABEAP; and has selected this option in writing, the individual will be responsible for all associated costs of case managed  aftercare as per the case management  eligibility  criteria  established.  The  associated  costs  may  include  the substance abuse assessment, post assessment counselling, return to work testing, followup testing and case management services provided by the third party case administrator and administrative costs.
- 3) Where  the  Local  Lodge  and  the  individual  have  agreed  in  writing  to  participate  in continuing case managed aftercare including offsite testing and where the

individual  has  either  a  follow-up  A&amp;D  test  result  that  is  reported  by  the  MRO  as  a positive, a refusal to test, or a failure to attend a collection site for a scheduled off- site follow up test, the individual's status will be classified as inactive. The individual, when classified inactive, will be ineligible for dispatch until his/her status is classified as active by  the  3 rd party  case  administrator.  The  individual  will  be  required  to  self-fund  all associated  costs  (as  listed  in  2)  above)  and  comply  with  the  recommendations  as reported in the SAE Report to be classified as  active.

- 4) This Letter of Understanding shall be attached to and form part of the maintenance agreement between the parties and its duration will mirror that of the  agreement.

- a. Article 2.2 (d) shall be interpreted so that the term 'Industry Stakeholder' shall include and incorporate the bargaining agent or labour provider to which employees belongs.
- b. 4.2.2 (c) -The words 'Inform a co -worker, a supervisor or a representative of the company to which the employee may belong, of their wish to contact a person responsible for the administration of an EAP' shall be interpreted to be 'Inform a co -worker, a bargaining agent, a labour provider, a supervisor, a representative of the company to which the employee may belong, of their wish to contact a person responsible for the administration of an EAP'.

If the Employer fails to refer the employee to Homewood Health within two (2) weeks and the employee is no longer eligible for the payment program under the BCA's funding model, then the Employer must pay all costs associated with the program on behalf of that employee.

It is understood that an investigation and a standard process for such investigation will be followed to ensure reasonable grounds have been established.

## Article 1.503

## Compressed Work Week Shift Premiums

- i) Number of hours on shift per cycle x number of cycles per year = NUMBER OF HOURS ON SHIFT PER YEAR.
2. ii) Number of hours on shift per year x shift premium = TOTAL SHIFT PREMIUM.

2. ii) Number of actual hours per year minus number of hours in a standard year = NUMBER OF OVERTIME HOURS PER YEAR.
3. iii) Number of overtime hours per year x overtime premium (2X) x Long-Term rate = TOTAL OVERTIME DOLLARS.
4. iv) Standard hours per year x Long-Term rate plus total overtime dollars (divided by the actual hours of work per year) = COMPRESSED WORK WEEK OVERTIME RATE.

## Article 1.505

- i) A year is defined as three hundred and sixty-four (364) days (fifty-two (52) x seven (7)).
2. ii) A standard year is two thousand and eighty (2,080) hours (fifty-two (52) x forty (40)).
3. iii) Total hours per cycle is defined as the sum of the hours worked on all days in cycle.
4. iv) Number  of  cycles  =  NUMBER  OF  DAYS  IN  A  CYCLE  DIVIDED  INTO  THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FOUR (364).

## APPENDIX B

## CF INDUSTRIES - SCHEDULED DAY OFF SCHEDULE

## Appendix -Scheduled Day Off Schedule (SDO), CF Industries (Medicine Hat)

To  harmonize  with  the  Owner's  in  plant  personnel  at  CF  Industries,  the  Employer  has  been approved to work an 8-9-9-8-8 work week on a Monday to Friday rotation at the facility. It is intended for on-going work (core maintenance work) and does not operate in unplanned outages, scheduled outages or during 'major shutdown' situations.

Guidelines of the 8-9-9-8-8 Schedule are as follows:

- 1) The schedule for regular core maintenance activities will operate on an 8-9-9-8-8 rotation on a Monday to Friday basis.
- 2) Employees will be paid in full for all hours worked each week. (For example, if someone completes the regular  8-9-9-8-8  schedule,  they  will  be  compensated  for  forty-two  (42) hours  at  the  regular  straight  time  hourly  rate  and  all  required  contributions  under  the collective agreement will be compensated based upon fort-two (42) hours.
- 3) The first two hours of overtime on the 8-9-9-8-8 will be compensated at time and one half (1 ½).
- 4) The Employer will identify the core maintenance personnel who will operate under the SDO schedule.
- 5) When  submitting  requests  for  craft  personnel  to  the  local  union,  the  Employer  will identify if the individual being hired is to be part of the core maintenance team.
- 6) The Employer will keep a record for each employee and track the number of nine (9) hour days  worked at straight time.
- 7) Should an employee be asked to work a Scheduled Day Off the following will apply:
- a) Work on a SDO will be on a voluntary basis.
- b) All  work  on  the  SDO  will  be  paid  in  accordance  with  the  number  of  hours  an individual employee has worked since the last SDO. For example: if an individual has worked three (3) of the scheduled nine (9) hour days and are asked to work an SDO, the first five (5) hours on the schedule will be paid at the straight time rate and all additional  hours  will  be  compensated  at  the  appropriate  overtime  rate  as  per  the collective agreement.
- c) The SDO schedule will be suspended during unscheduled and scheduled outages as well  as  during  major  shutdowns/turnarounds.  (The  e mployee's  accumulated  hours worked on the nine (9) hour days will remain frozen until their return to the regular SDO Schedule.)
