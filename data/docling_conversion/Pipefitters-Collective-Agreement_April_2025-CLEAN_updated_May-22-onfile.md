- 7.06 The Employer and the Union agree that there will be no discrimination against any Employee for reasons as stipulated under Alberta legislation.
- 7.07 (a) The Union agrees to furnish competent workers embracing the UA Standard for Excellence to the Employer on request, provided however, that the Employer shall have the right to determine the

competency and qualifications of such persons and shall have the right to reject any person or to discharge any Employee for just cause.  The Employer

- shall not discriminate against any Employee by reason of their membership in the Union or their participation in its lawful activities.  The reason/cause of the rejection/termination of the Employee will be relayed in writing to the Union.
- (b) Workers dispatched by the Union must present their trade qualifications if requested by the Employer, at the time of dispatch.  The parties are committed to eliminating unnecessary, duplicative safety training.  Therefore, workers are expected to disclose to the Employer any current safety training certificates that may be required for that job, as identified by the employer at the point of dispatch.  The Employer shall supply a single point of contact for the purpose of supplying this information by way of email, fax, or phone.  Following the acceptance of a dispatch slip, workers shall promptly remit to the Employer, copies of any applicable safety certificates by fax, email, or personal presentation at an address of the Employer or any other method that will achieve this objective
- (c) If  an  Employer  requires  an  employee  to  complete  an  employer  online  orientation,  the Employer shall estimate a reasonable amount of time to complete the orientation.  The Employer shall pay an allowance for completing the course equal to the time estimated, to a maximum of four (4) hours, multiplied by the employee's base rate only and payable with the first pay period following the start of work. Payment for online orientation will not attract VSP or any benefit contributions.
- 7.08 Where the Employer has requested the Union office to furnish workers to perform work within the scope of this Agreement, and the required number of workers are not furnished within two (2) working days, after the date for which the workers are requested, the Employer shall have the right to procure the required number of workers from other available sources, provided, however, that such workers procured from other available sources shall be required by the Employer to make application to join the Union, if acceptable, not later than thirty (30) calendar days after hiring, and obtain a dispatch slip from the Union office or the Employer shall notify and obtain clearance from the Union office before engaging such persons.  In such circumstances, clearance by the Union will not be withheld.
- 7.09 Provided the Union can supply the Employer with qualified tradesmen, who are members of the appropriate Union, the Employer agrees that at any time on the request of the Union representative giving forty-eight  (48)  hours'  notice,  any  other  persons  working  at  the  trade  shall  be  laid  off. However, where certain skills may be required on site, the parties may, by mutual consent, waive this  requirement. Prospective members awaiting initiation, who have met the requirements for initiation into membership are considered to be members for the purpose of this agreement.

## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

- 7.10 In reducing the number of Employees required, members of the appropriate Union(s) shall be the last to be laid off, depending on which jurisdictional area

the Employer's project is located in. Workers on the project may be offered the opportunity to exercise  the  option  to  accept  voluntary  lay-off  when  there  are  lay-offs  planned  on  the  project affecting their trade.  In such cases, this option will be offered to Local Union members first, travel card members second, and workers on permits third.

Workers remaining on a project following a lay-off must be capable and qualified to perform the remaining work.  For example, a lay-off of welders will not impact steamfitter-pipefitters and vice versa.    A  lay-off  of  apprentices  will  similarly  not  impact  on  journeypersons.    Within  these parameters, lay-offs will be carried out in the following sequence following any voluntary lay-offs as noted above:

## REDUCTION IN CREWS

-  FIRST: Potential members (Permits)
-  SECOND: Travel Card members (Members of Sister United Association Locals)
-  THIRD: Members of the appropriate Union

It is expressly understood that Clause 7.09 shall be in full effect in relation to any reduction in crews.

Legislated Apprentice ratios shall be adhered to at all times.

- 7.11 Members of the Union dispatched from the Union office reporting for work at the time and place specified by the Employer and who are not engaged by the Employer shall receive a minimum of two (2) hours locally or four (4) hours beyond 300 km reporting pay, plus travel allowance and expense, if applicable.

This Clause does not apply where the Employer has notified the Union(s) in a reasonable time that the Employee is not eligible for hire.

## ARTICLE EIGHT - WAGES, BENEFITS &amp; MONETARY CONDITIONS

8.01 Wage Rates and Fringe Benefits shall be in accordance with the following schedules:

Employers shall have the option to pay by payroll cheque or to pay by direct deposit to the bank account of the Employee's choice.  Where direct deposit is used, Employees will be provided with pay summaries on pay day which can be sent by fax to out of town jobs if necessary.

If the Employer has been notified at least one (1) working day prior to payroll cut off for the next pay period and the correction(s) is/are not made, there will be a penalty equivalent of two (2) hours at base rate, for every working day until the correction(s) is/are made beyond payday.

Except for the matters set out in articles 11.12(b) and 11.12(c) below, the Canadian Model [the 'Canadian  Model' ],  will  be  implemented  by  agreement  under  this  Collective Agreement for the purposes set out in section 2.0 of the Canadian Model , and the Parties will co-operate with each other in achieving those purposes.

## (b) Random Testing

Notwithstanding any provisions of the Collective Agreement or any special agreements appended thereto, section 4.6 of the Canadian Model will not be applied by agreement.  If applied to a worker dispatched by the Union, it will be applied or deemed to be applied unilaterally by the Employer.  The Union retains the right to grieve the legality of any imposition of random testing in accordance with the Grievance Procedure set out in this Collective Agreement.

- (c) Site Access Testing and Dispatch Conditions

Notwithstanding any provisions of the Collective Agreement or any special agreements appended thereto, section 4.7 of the Canadian Model will not be applied by agreement.  If applied to a worker dispatched by the Union, it will be applied or deemed to be applied unilaterally by the Employer.  The Union retains the right to grieve the legality of any imposition of site access testing in accordance with the Grievance Procedure set out in this Collective Agreement.

If the Employer acting independently or as agent of the owner or if the owner itself imposes site  access  testing,  section  5.5  of  the  Canadian  Model  will  not  be  applicable  to  testing pursuant to section 4.7.  In addition, neither the Union nor the individual will be under any obligation under the Canadian Model with respect to such a positive test.

## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

There will be no mandatory referrals for site access test failures or no shows for new hires, as no employment relationship has yet been established. However, the employer will be required to provide notice to the union within two business days from the date they become aware of the results.

The union shall be responsible for reimbursement to the employer, for the associated costs of the pre-access alcohol and drug tests, if the worker is dispatched (list hired) from the union hall and provides a non-negative result for the alcohol and/or drug test, refuses to test or is a no-show for the test. The union may seek reimbursement from the member for the costs reimbursed to the employer. This clause would not be applicable if the worker was name hired by the employer.

The member may choose to voluntarily self-disclose/refer to the Case Managed Aftercare program (SAE/RTWT/PAC/FUT).

Note: This principle does not apply to site transfers as that site access test occurs during the employment relationship.

## ARTICLE TWENTY-EIGHT - SAVING CLAUSE

- 28.01 Should any article, any provision, or any part of this Agreement be void by reason of being contrary to law, the remainder of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby.

## ARTICLE TWENTY-NINE - TRAVEL, TRAVEL ALLOWANCE, TRANSPORTATION AND ACCOMMODATION

## Daily Travel

- 29.01 The  following  conditions  as  listed  in  Clauses  29.01  to  29.03  will  apply  on  jobs  within  daily commuting distance of Edmonton, Calgary, or any location with a hiring hall, and on jobs from which Employees commute daily from temporary accommodation provided or paid for by the Employer.
- (a) A forty-five (45) kilometer radius free zone from the center of the cities of Edmonton or Calgary; (Geodetic Monument) or around any place in which Employees are temporarily domiciled by the Employer shall be established.  The location of the Geodetic Monument for Edmonton is 101 Street and Jasper Avenue and for Calgary, the Calgary Tower.  No transportation or travel allowance shall be applicable within the free zone
- (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, on major construction projects located within the free zone, around the cities of Edmonton and Calgary, but beyond the city bus transportation system of those cities, where it is expected that the total construction workforce will exceed 500, the  affected  parties  shall  meet  to  discuss  the  viability  of  implementing  a  system  of providing transportation to the site.  The parties shall take into account such considerations as climate, seasons, road capacity, other projects and industries using the same corridors, workforce curves, and site infrastructure
- (c) The  time  in  transit  on  buses  between  the  site  and  the  camp  shall  be  determined  by representatives of the Building Trades of Alberta and of the Coordinating Committee of Registered Employers' Organizations, based on an average during a reference week of five test runs each way, conducted coincident with the times when workers are in transit.  This determination should be carried out twice per year, with any adjustment resulting from a determination applicable until the next determination.  Workers shall be paid an allowance for time regularly and routinely in excess of forty five minutes each way, for travel within the applicable free zone.  The allowance shall be calculated on the regular straight time base rate of each worker.  The allowance will be paid only to workers who ride on the provided buses, and only for the days on which they ride the buses.
- 29.02 (a) For projects beyond the forty-five kilometer (45 km) free zone for which daily travel is required, the Employer will have the following options;
-  to provide transportation and pay travel allowance, or
-  reimburse the Employees, as a vehicle allowance, ( See Travel Allowance Memo at www.clra.org) per kilometer traveled, each way between the edge of the free zone and the project job site daily and pay travel allowance.

The  travel  allowance  shall  be  calculated  based  on  traveling  at  80  km  per  hour,  at  the Employee's applicable base rate, from the point where the edge of the 45 km radius free zone intersects the road which takes the shortest, most appropriate route, to the project and return to the intersecting point.

The  Coordinating  Committee  and  the  Alberta  Building  Trades  Council  shall  examine, during January of each year of the Collective Agreement, the information published by

## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

Canada Revenue Agency respecting the vehicle allowance amounts that will not be treated as taxable income, and that will be permitted as business expenses for Employers.  Such information normally establishes a maximum rate for the first 5,000 km, and a lower rate for additional kilometres.  The Coordinating Committee and the Council shall determine a rate that is midway between those two rates.  The above vehicle allowance rate shall be adjusted, effective on the first pay period following May 1 of each year, to the rate so determined by the Coordinating Committee and the Council.

Example Only -- A Journeyman member traveling to a project located 40 road kilometers from the edge of the free zone at 80km per hour each way would receive the following for each day worked:

| Travel Allowance: 80 km @80 km/hr.                          | Travel Rate             |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Vehicle Allowance: 80 km.@ 65¢ per km. for a daily total of | Vehicle Rate Total Rate |

Where the Employer provides the transportation the travel allowance would be paid but the vehicle allowance would not be payable.

- (b) Where the Employer supplies the transportation, such transportation shall, at a minimum, be a safe, clean, and modern means of transportation with sufficient seating for each person allowing  adequate  comfort  for  adults.    School  buses  shall  not  be  used  for  such transportation.  Where the Employer is supplying transportation, and when the size of the crew is such that the capacity of a coach-type bus is required, such bus transportation will be provided.  Pick up points shall be mutually agreed upon.
- (c) Employees who are transported to a job site but who refuse to start work at the prescribed time  due  to  a  picket  line  or  other  form  of  labour  relations  dispute  will  not  be  paid transportation or travel allowance for that day.
- (d) When the transportation provided by the Employer for the conveyance of Employees is delayed by circumstances that are reasonably within the control of the Employer or the bussing company, the Employees shall be paid for all such time, providing the delay is in excess of 15 minutes, beyond the scheduled arrival time, up to a limit of two (2) hours at the applicable straight time rate.
- (e) If  an  Employee  is  required  by  the  Employer  to  move  from  one  job  to  another  during working hours, the Employer shall provide the transportation or pay vehicle allowance at the  rate  established  by  the  formula  in  29.02  (a)  above  per  kilometre  traveled  if  the Employee uses their own vehicle.  The Employee shall not suffer any loss of pay as a result of transferring between projects during working hours.
- (f) Employees required to travel out of a city or town to another job after working a shift, and before an eight (8) hour break occurs, shall be paid for all time traveled at the rate of time and one-half the normal rate.  If still traveling the following day, the Employee shall be paid the normal rate for time traveled during the regular working day only.

- (g) Should an Employee residing in camp accommodation be requested by the Employer or the client's designated camp management personnel to move to another room or camp, they shall be paid two (2) hours at the applicable straight time rates to carry out the move.
- (h) When an Employee is being paid subsistence allowance in accordance with Article 29.04 and when there is no suitable accommodation available within 45 km. of the project on which the Employee is engaged, the Employer shall determine the location of the nearest available  suitable  accommodation  and  shall  determine  the  number  of  road  kilometers beyond a 45 kilometer radius of the project that would be required to travel each way from the nearest available suitable accommodation, and shall calculate the travel allowance in accordance  with  those  provisions  as  identified  in  Article  29.02.    In  the  event  suitable accommodations  within  a  45  kilometer  radius  of  the  project  becomes  available,  the payment of the travel allowance will cease.

## COMMERCIAL/INSTITUTIONAL

29.03

- (a) For projects beyond the forty-five kilometre (45 km) free zone for which daily travel is required,  then  the  Employer  will  provide  transportation,  plus  a  travel  allowance  to  be negotiated in consultation with the Union, however, in the event no Agreement is reached with the Union then a decision shall be made by the Registered Employers' Organization, which decision shall be final and binding.

- (iv) On a project/jobsite located over two hundred  and fifty (250) radius kilometers from  the  geographic  centers  of  either  the  City  of  Edmonton  or  Calgary  (as applicable) one  additional day's subsistence shall be paid for the use of accommodation  for  the  night  following  the  last  day  worked,  provided  that  the Employee  presents  a  bona-fide  commercial  receipt  to  their  Employer  for  each

## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

- (d) The parties agree that wherever practical and workable in all of the circumstances of the project, camp accommodation is preferable to the provision of room and board, and that the provision of room and board is preferable to the payment of subsistence allowance. However, any of these three options will satisfy the Employer's obligations pursuant to this article.
- (e) (i) In certain situations, Employees may be dispatched or directed to work on projects which are in an area where the cost of available suitable single  room accommodation and/or meals may be in excess of the daily rate of subsistence set out in this Article.  In such a case, the Employer shall provide one of the following options:

In the event that the majority of the Committee determines that the allowance is insufficient to purchase such lodging  and  meals  the  Committee  shall  determine  the  amount  by  which  the subsistence allowance shall be adjusted.  A decision of the Committee as to whether the allowance is sufficient or whether a specified adjustment is necessary shall be final  and  binding  provided  that  the  majority  of  the  Committee  agrees  with  the resolve.  Any such mutually agreed upon decision shall be issued within five (5) days  from  the  date  of  referral,  or  such  longer  period  as  may  be  agreed  by  the Coordinating Committee and the Building Trades.

The Umpire shall render a final and binding decision as to whether the subsistence allowance is sufficient  to  allow  an  Employee  to  purchase  accommodation  and  meals  in  the subject  community  or  communities,  and  if  it  is  not  the  amount  by  which  the allowance should be adjusted to afford the purchase of available lodging and meals. The  decision  of  the  Umpire  shall  be  rendered  within  five  (5)  full  days  of  the Umpire's appointment, or such longer period as may be agreed by the Coordinating Committee and the Building Trades.  The decision of the Umpire shall have the same binding effect and shall be subject to the same limited review as a decision of an arbitrator in grievance proceedings.  The fees and disbursements of the Umpire shall be borne equally by the Coordinating Committee and the referring Union.

scheduled within consecutive scheduled days), an employee, at the time of dispatch, will be allowed to elect to use the such employer provided transportation or to receive collective agreement initial/return/rotation allowances.  Buses must comply with Article 29.02(b).

-  An  employee who  has elected Collective Agreement initial/return/rotation allowances  will  no  longer  be  paid  any  such  payments  not  yet  received  if transportation is established and the employee elects to use it.

Should the Employee remain on the job until completion of thirty (30) calendar days, or until completion of the dispatched job requirement, whichever may be the lesser, they shall receive the return transportation allowance to be paid with their final pay cheque.

If  the  Employee  is  transferred  to  a  different  work  site  which  is  outside  the  same geographical region for which the transportation allowance was to apply (e.g., the Fort McMurray region, the Cold Lake Region, etc.), that Employee will be paid any outstanding transportation allowance(s) with their next regular pay.  If the Employee is transferred to a different work site that is within the same geographical region to which the transportation allowance was to apply, the Employee's employment on that different work site shall be deemed to be a continuation of employment on the original work site for the purposes of accumulation of entitlement to transportation allowances and rotational allowances where applicable.  Should an Employee choose not to accept a transfer, he/she shall be paid all applicable travel allowances and be considered to be laid off.

## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

## Whereas

An individual must be referred to a substance abuse expert following a failure to comply with the Canadian Model for Providing a Safe Workplace: Alcohol and Drug Guidelines and Work Rule (the 'Canadian Model').  Once the  individual  is  assessed  by  a  substance  abuse  expert,  recommendations  are  prepared  and  disclosed  for  the purpose of establishing expectations in accordance with the substance abuse expert's recommendations, entering into a post assessment agreement, and supporting compliance with prescribed aftercare.

After the Union becomes aware a member has violated the Canadian Model excluding owner/client required site access  testing;  the  member  must  be  assessed  by  a  substance  abuse  expert  and  comply  with  the  resulting recommendations as a condition of being eligible for future dispatches.

If the union is aware of a non-negative test result or a refusal on a site access test, the union would internally manage the situation with their member and may impose a time limited no dispatch or provide assistance under the EFAP or health and welfare program.

There are advantages to referring substance abuse expert recommendations to qualified third party professionals for administration on behalf of the Parties.  Third party professionals are positioned to offer a higher level of:

- a) confidentiality,
- b) consistency, and
- c) expertise.

Contracting the administration of substance abuse expert recommendations to third party professionals is expected to be more effective in meeting the safety objectives contained in the Canadian Model and increase the quality of service afforded to affected individuals.

## Re: Referral for Case Managed Aftercare

## Now therefore, it is Agreed between the Parties hereto that:

- 1) Substance  abuse  expert  recommendations  arising  from  contractor  administered  A&amp;D  tests  conducted pursuant to the Canadian Model and arising from those who violate Article 3 of the Canadian Model shall be referred to and administered by Organizational Health Incorporated (third party professionals).  Such substance  abuse  expert  recommendations  shall  apply  to  employment  and  prospective  employment  in respect  to  any  collective  agreement  for  which  the  Union  is  signatory.   Substance  abuse  expert recommendations shall be shared with a contractor only if they are in respect to a current employee, one that has contravened article 3 of the Canadian Model while in the employ of that Employer.
- 2) Service providers, including Organizational Health Incorporated, will keep all information in accordance with applicable privacy laws.
- 3) The Association will provide funding to the third-party providers who are responsible for administering substance abuse expert recommendations.
- 4) This Letter of Understanding shall be attached to and form part of the Collective Agreement entered into between the Parties.

## Mechanical Collective Agreement 2025/29

## Whereas:

- 1) The Parties are committed to creating a safer, healthier workplace free of risks associated with alcohol and/or other drug use.  Historical trends suggest meeting this objective will correlate to a reduction in workplace incidents.
- 2) The  Parties  intend  to  reduce  redundant  substance  testing  and  related  costs  and  to  expedite  access  to participating worksites.
- 3) Alcohol and other drug work rules, such as the Canadian Model for Providing a Safe Workplace: Alcohol and Drug Guidelines and Work Rule (the 'Canadian Model' ), are more effective if they are implemented in such a way as to preserve the dignity and privacy of participant workers.
- 4) Coordinating the exchange of sensitive information through a centralized third party provides greater control over the collection, use, disclosure, safeguards and storage of personal information.
- 5) Retaining the continuity of information through a centralized third party is necessary in order to reduce redundant  testing,  expedite  access  to  worksites  and  provide  seamless  after-care  support  to  affected workers.
- 6) Comprehensive  professional  third-party  case  administration  provides  for  the  effective  delivery  of education, compliance and, if necessary, accommodation strategies.  Professional treatment, education, follow-up  and  after-care  frameworks  support  affected  workers  in  maintaining  compliance  with  the Canadian Model and, if necessary, recovering from an addiction and/or dependency to alcohol or other drugs.
- 7) In 2004, the Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and, in 2008, leading experts in direct consultation, confirmed that laboratory oral fluid testing is accurate, reliable and appropriate for unannounced testing.  Due to the shorter detection windows than found in urine testing, it was found that oral fluid testing is not appropriate for follow-up testing and not appropriate for testing where prior notice of the test is given.
- 8) Several arbitration cases have accepted the validity of laboratory oral fluid testing but in none of those cases was the laboratory oral fluid testing itself the subject of challenge.

Accordingly, at the time of signing this agreement the validity of laboratory oral fluid testing has yet to be established in Canadian law.

- (b) The Union's agreement in (a) above is subject to the adoption of laboratory based oral fluid testing for the random component of drug testing administered by the Rapid Site Access Program.  However, in the event laboratory oral fluid testing is successfully challenged in law the Union agrees urine-based testing shall apply.
- (c) Subject  to  (b)  above,  where  the  Union  does  not  agree  to  an  amendment  to  the Rapid  Site  Access Program Procedural Rules, the Union may opt out of agreeing to said amendment by giving notice in writing to the registered employers' organization and the Rapid Site Access Administrative Committee.
- (d) For Industrial work, the employer contributions shall be established by the CLR and may be changed by the Board of Directors of Construction Labour Relations - An Alberta Association, and notice to an Employer and the Union from the Association respecting such amendment shall be sufficient.  RSAP contributions  shall  be  forwarded  to  Construction  Labour  Relations  at # 207,  2725  -  12 th Street  NE, Calgary Alberta T2E 7J2.  These contributions shall be used by CLR to provide funding, among other things, for the third party providers who are responsible for delivering the services in respect to the Rapid Site Access Program.

This Letter of Understanding shall be attached to and form part of the Collective Agreement entered between the Parties.

All of which is Agreed this 4 th      day of       MAY , 2025
